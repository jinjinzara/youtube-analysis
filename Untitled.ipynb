       "[\"today we're going to be durability testing the new aluminum iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 plus we already know the iPhone 15 Pro Max didn't survive may it Rest In Pieces I get a lot of questions of how I prepare for events like this and how I get enough nourishment for snapping phones in half well huge thanks to huel for sponsoring this video I lost about 15 pounds a year ago and I've kept it off ever since thanks to counting calories in just a few seconds he will black makes eating healthy easy by being exactly 400 calories of nutritionally complete plant-based proteins carbs and 27 essential vitamins and minerals the stuff humans need to survive whether I'm bending aluminum or titanium I can't do it without my vitamins and take a look at all of these good things personally I like the cookies and cream it's my absolute favorite I haven't come across one I haven't liked yet I take that back salted caramel is not on my favorites list but luckily there's eight other flavors to from and the important thing is is that they don't have artificial sweeteners you don't have to take my word for it though huel has sold over 300 million meals in over 100 million countries whoa that's a lot of countries let me start again huel has sold over 300 million meals in 100 different countries and you get a free T-shirt with your order as a special bonus if you spend over 100 and use my code jrig everything 15 you will get 15 off your order but only for the next 72 hours link is down in the description if you want to try it out for yourself and now that we're fueled let's get started [Music] foreign [Music] way to tell if your iPhone is real or genuine and not a sneakily sealed up box with a brick in it is with a sweet little hologram thing that Apple added to the sticker of each box 100 invisible to the naked eye you'll have to have a UV flashlight to see it which aren't too expensive or you know just buy your phone from somewhere or someone reputable this is my first time seeing the new aluminum iPhone 15 lineup and I gotta say these aren't so much colors as they are just different shades of white Apple says this is green but I say it's what we'd get after putting five potatoes and a green bean in a blender got a braided usb-c cable though which is nice thank you this is either what smartphones are going to look like in heaven or the first blade of grass you see after getting hit with the flashbang Jokes Aside the iPhone 15 does feel incredibly good I can't quite describe it but holding it in my hand gives me the same wow Vibes that I got for the first time holding an iPhone 4 way back in the day the super flat glass leading right up to the contoured aluminum frame I genuinely approve of these design tweaks I almost scratched it that would be embarrassing plus the USBC Port is just bringing the whole world together and is perfect I'm being far too clumsy today I apologize we better move on before something happens to this phone oh yeah I am that something Apple has their own proprietary glass called ceramic Shield we see Plastics ratchet level two or three glass and a five or six and Sapphire at a level eight or nine and after working our way up through moscale of hardness on this iPhone 15 I just can't say it this time if I squint my eyes and really struggle I can make out some tiny marks at level six and scratches at a level seven which I know doesn't quite have the same ring to it but I mean you can see for yourself Apple's glass is definitely more scratch resistant than Android class ceramic shield with all of its Crystal infused buzzwords is actually an improvement over regular tempered glass so thumbs up for that the 12 megapixel front-facing camera is tucked up into the massive Dynamic Island which technically we can make fun of all day long but at the same time the Apple Engineers have worked some pretty awesome features into this thing like the airline gate I'm over here on my Android phone checking my email five times as I walk down the terminal because I have the memory of a goldfish and apple just has it displayed I'm just saying I'm a little jealous but only sometimes it looks like apple again added the Invincible 5G adamantium antenna oval and the rest of the anodized aluminum scratches pretty easy including the power button Apple doesn't specify which series of aluminum they're using this time around and it could be six or seven thousand series I'll see if I can get it fluorescently scanned with x-rays and find out here in another video soon so make sure you're subscribed for that the USBC Port is USB 2 which is just as fast at transferring data as the previous lightning Port this phone is colored like a four-year-old who ran out of food dye during an Easter egg contest I do really like the feel of the matte finish though Apple tried to tell us that there are three cameras up here during their event but any four-year-old without food coloring could easily tell us there are only two the lower is a 48 megapixel main camera lens Apple says the sensor is big enough for a 4X crop turning the main lens into an optical telephoto but if you're only using a fraction of the sensor is it still considered Optical personally I'd say no there's a 12 megapixel wide angle camera up top which I guess according to Apple's math is a 12x Optical if you cropped a one megapixel one of the Apple designers probably mowed his lawn and then walked across marble tile and was like that's the color of the next iPhone on the front of the phone we have 6.1 inches worth of 2 000 nits super retina xdr HDR and as we can tell by the white dot burning into the screen OLED I would have gone longer but the app started quivering and I am merciful sometimes finally the ultimate test of structure and rigidity that most phones do survive the bin test for some reason the iPhone 15 Pro Max just didn't make it we'll start with the same position as we did with the pro Max with pressure from the back and nothing we're off to a good start or a bad start depending on what you're here for the screen kind of stopped working for a bit which is strange but after a quick flick on and off it came back to life continuing the bin from the front again nothing this sunbleached Skittle of a phone survives the bitten test enter the iPhone 15 plus with essence of blue it wasn't the smaller of the pro phones that broke it was the larger so it's only fair that we also been test the larger 15 plus as well which has the exact same features as the 15. there are quite a few reasons why a phone could break microscopic imperfections in the materials flaws in casting or Milling consistent manufacturing is extremely difficult especially with so many different puzzle pieces that have to fit together precisely and just because one phone breaks doesn't necessarily mean that they all will I mean they might but they also might not lucky for apple and this freezer burned iPhone 15 plus no amount of bending from the back or the front causes any damage that means three of the four new iPhones from Apple survive my durability test thanks for subscribing and thanks

       " \"all right so today I got a hold of and got to poke around the new iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pros I do remember flying here and I'm thinking what could Apple possibly do like what could they possibly introduce with a new iPhone the 23rd iPhone that's actually interesting now there is more stuff than just the iPhone that was mentioned at this Wonder lust event that Apple hosted including some stuff that straight up wasn't mentioned on stage at all so we'll get to that but this is just the new iPhone stuff so stay tuned to get subscribed to see the rest but let's just talk about the new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro so here's a lens to look at all this stuff through coming into this basically everything Apple just added to their newest Flagship phones falls into two buckets it's either something we've already seen in some other phone for years or it's some ecosystem feature that only works with other iPhones which is not necessarily a bad thing but it's just just a lens to look through this stuff at just to keep an eye on it so this is the iPhone 15 there's the same two sizes again iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 plus and yeah you know there's some small changes like the slight soft Corner radi on the aluminum rails and the one piece glass back fading between a lighter and darker version of the same color like this new pink one it's pretty seamless also satin soft touch backs across the whole lineup instead of glossy I definitely like that but the big headlining feature really is it's USB now lightning is officially dead these new iPhones are all USBC across the board now on one hand this is a huge deal like there's only ever been one Port change in the iPhone ever back in 2012 we went from that 30 pin connector thing to this new lightning thing which we've had ever since and now the second one ever is USB type-c but on the other hand it's I don't know it's just USB like it's the same port all these other laptops and tablets all over the planet I've had for the past couple years I imagine it might be another year or two before the whole lineup like the Baseline cheap iPad and the iPhone SC and everything else gets USBC but yeah I don't know we knew it was coming but it's still kind of surreal to look at an iPhone and see a USB port on it so what does this enable it's a real question right uh first of all it's the one cable that you can ideally use to charge all your stuff so your Mac your iPad your iPhone your friends Android phone the new airpods which just got a new USBC case all that stuff one cable oh and now you can charge accessories like the new airpods with the wire so there's no Wireless reverse charging right now but that ctoc cable that comes in the Box so you can like plug it in the iPhone plug it into the airpods and charge the airpods up from the iPhone battery so that's pretty cool but they did hold back on one very key thing and they saved it for the iPhone 15 Pro so I'll get to that in a bit but that's USBC aside from that really it's a slightly updated phone it's a little bit of a new display you know you get the dynamic Island here of course on these Baseline iPhones and there's also now a higher Peak brightness 2,000 nits now which is twice as bright as the iPhone 14s and there's a new camera the primary camera is now a 48 megapixel chip presumably the same one that was in the iPhone 14 pro last year and all the benefits that come with that and then the rest of the phone really follows that same formula they do this thing where the new Baseline phone is basically last year's Pro phone repackage so it inherits the same a16 Bionic chip from last year's Pro phone the coolest feature of this phone though and you know it's also in the Pro phone but I still think it's pretty solid is the camera has this new Next Generation portrait mode but basically automatically detects when there's a subject in a photo and captures all of the depth information needed to be able to turn it into a portrait mode photo later so you don't have to remember to switch it to portrait mode necessarily every time and if you ever forget but want to add that blur later you can do it with high quality results so that's cool aside from that the rest of the phone I mean it's the same thing right same sizes guys same ceramic Shield same dust and water resistance and same starting prices $7.99 for the 15 and $8.99 for the 15 plus so then there is the pro phones the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max there is some more new here a lot of it I'm actually want to going to want to test just to see if it's actually what they say but make sure you get subscribed to see those full reviews when they come out later this month and we can figure out if the phones are worth it but basically it's not bleeding edge stuff that we've never seen before it's just welcome stuff and those are mostly in build quality the chip inside and the cameras so let's just start with the chip inside first of all it's a brand new chip that's called the A7 Pro it's the first time they've used the word Pro in an iPhone chip and it's their first 3 nanometer chip so it promises some performance and efficiency improvements as a result I think they said it's like 10% faster high performance cores and the neural engines up to twice as fast bunch of other stuff not sure how much of this you'll actually notice in everyday use but hey future proofing and Headroom is never a bad thing so this is clearly a powerful chip they showed a demo of a game with like faster raid tracing which isn't new but you know it helped make their point but the interesting thing to note here with this chip is they mentioned the chip has a new usb3 controller on it which means the 15 and 15 plus don't have that so basically that means the pro iPhone's USBC Port actually gets upgraded usb3 speeds the faster data transfer speeds up to 10 gbits per second but the base iPhones without that controller they get USBC but they're going to be stuck at USB 2.0 speeds basically the same we've always had with lightning like 480 megabits per second now this probably won't make a real difference to most people like I don't know when the last time you plugged your phone in was but it's kind of a bummer that not all of the benefits of USBC come to all of the phones uh but for the pro phones that are going to be shooting more prores video or Pro Raw photos I mean it takes forever if you've shot this stuff like I have you know it takes forever to get those off of the phone cuz they're big files so I kind of wish they'd gone all the way I wish they' done Thunderbolt speeds 20 30 40 megabits gigabits per second uh but yeah it's it's just going to be USB 3 on the pro iPhones and USB 2 on the bass iPhones you know what is disappointing though no fast charging like this I talked about this on the podcast on waveform I'll try to link the episode below but like switching the USBC you'd think oh this is a huge opportunity for Apple to like explain why they're doing it and we know why they're doing it but oh why are you giving us this new port and all this this big new USBC deal and it's it's just the same 20 or so watt charging we've had for the iPhone for forever no new fast charging kind of figured they would try to do that better but yeah this will still take an hour and a half 2 hours to charge but anyway the new design is what most people are fawning over at the moment with the pros so they have switched the rails from that shiny fingerprint stainless steel to this new grade five titanium alloy with a brushed texture and it's nice it is first of all it's noticeably lighter in the hand which I love and it seems like it's also enabled them to shrink the body of the pro iPhones just a little bit so they have the same screen sizes but the screens now get even closer to the edges and there's even thinner slightly thinner bezels and I actually do notice that now a lot of people are also quoting stronger as one of the benefits too but I really don't think this is going to make as much of a difference as people are thinking like the pro iPhones have had this stainless steel rails for a while now I've dropped this phone as you know I don't have a case on the ground I've dented the stainless steel rails it's fine it doesn't break it's not the stainless steel that breaks it's a glass that breaks and as far as we can tell it's the same ceramic shield glass on the iPhone 15 Pro that hasn't changed so if you drop it on the glass you're still going to have not great results uh but yeah technically sure titanium is stronger either way the new colors are black white and this new blue which is really subtle and then natural which I guess it kind of Embraces the raw titanium feel reminds me of Starlight if you're curious kind of like this warm tone weirdly I think I like it the most but also something else Apple said on stage and this this was pretty quick so you might not have even picked it up but they did mention that they have redesigned a bit of the interior of the chassis to make the back glass more replaceable so it's a more repairable iPhone design technically it's a small thing it's just one little step but it's a step in the right direction for a more repairable iPhone but my favorite feature and before we get to any of the cameras I honestly think this is my favorite feature is uh the new action button a new customizable button on the side of the iPhone just the pro iPhone so it replaces the mute switch which is pretty iconic but it's in the same spot as the mute switch and it it's actually customizable so it's a pretty small button basically about the same size as the switch and by default it actually behaves just like the mute switch did so you you actually hold it down to switch between muted or ringer on great but if you dive into the settings there's actually a section for this action button and it's actually really in-depth and super solid it basically lets you go through and pick the function of the button and there's way more here than I expected so you can keep the mute switch on or you can have it switch you in and out of a certain Focus mode like do not disturb or you could pick whichever other one you want you could also have it auto launch the camera and pick whichever camera mode it opens you could also do flashlight turning on or opening up voice memos or it can toggle the magnifier or the last option actually is you can have it trigger a series shortcut which as you know can technically do almost anything including basically launching any app on your phone I think there may be a bit of a delay from the button press to the app opening if I'm thinking about this correctly like it's done in the past but I'll have to test that for the full review but theoretically you can map this button to open whatever your calendar app your to-do list app whatever app you want which is totally not what I expected to be on the list of things you could do with a new button on the side of the iPhone but now you can but then last but not least the new cameras across the board here there's a new larger 48 megapixel main sensor for the pros and improved Ultra wide and then the pro Max just the pro Max gets a new intricate folding 5x telephoto camera I'm guessing if I asked Apple they would say that there was only enough room in the bigger Pro Max to fit this folding lens I'll ask we'll see what they say but until then the regular 15 Pro is going to still have the 3x telephoto the regular 3x from last year and then we found this seemingly random feature it's in the settings they also talked about it in the keynote but where you can change your default focal length to be either 1X or 1.2x or 1.5x for some reason so it's buried in the middle of the camera settings but you can tell it to default to one of these specific three focal links so if you switch back to the camera app that 1X button is now always going to take you to the new focal length that you've chosen and you can still get to 1x or whatever other focal length you want but I just found that interesting so maybe if you somehow if you're someone that takes 1.2x photos so often that you want a button to get there as fast as possible because it's the perfect focal length for you then sure maybe if you're a photographer you don't want to do the work of digital cropping just hit that focal length every time sure but there's been a lot of comments that at the end of the day it feels like USB is literally the big biggest headlining new feature of this year's new iPhone which is crazy I I can't quite get rid of my lightning cable yet there's still some accessories there's like mag safe Duo there's airpods Max there's like the magic Trackpad there's a couple things that still are lightning now maybe they'll switch that in the next couple months but now I'm genuinely curious if there's going to be a bunch of new USBC phone accessories because of the iPhone getting USBC uh similar to our sponsor of this video ankor so they've made a whole new lineup products for the iPhone 15 headlined by the anchor Nano which is like this little small But Mighty USBC power bank that can crank out 30 Watts with the built-in USBC cable and you can also charge it up 30 WTS and if you have that little button up at the top here it'll actually show a literal percentage of how much battery you have left or if you're plugged in it'll show you a time which counts down so you really know exactly how much of the 10,000 milliamp hours you have left plus there's some other stuff in the lineup there's a wall charger braided USBC cables Galore so feel free to learn more about Anchor's new line up at the link below and shout out to Anker for sponsoring this video so iPhone 15 Pro will start at the same price as last year which is $9.99 but they've bumped up iPhone 15 Pro Max sneakily interestingly it will start at $1.99 but it's also the only one with a 5x camera and it's the only one that starts at 256 gigs and last year the price of the 256 gig Pro was the same so you're kind of matching it's just like getting rid of the $1,100 phone for some reason either way let me know if you're interested in these new iPhones at all you're either in Camp don't care at all or you're in Camp like totally getting one of these or maybe you're watching to see if the reviews prove that the new features are worth it let me know what you're thinking comment section's always open thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one get subscribe see you later [Music] peace\",\n",
       " \"all right so this is an iPhone 15 and a 15 plus and a 15 Pro and a 15 Pro Max every new phone in the lineup new colors new materials New Ports there's some good stuff to unbox here so let's do it so starting with iPhone 15 and 15 plus this iPhone 15 here is the new blue color and it is I'm just going to go ahead and rename this color to barely blue I think that's an appropriate name because it really is barely giving hints of blue you can really see it on the side rails too but yeah really subtle colors across the board this year anyway the other things in the Box are the paperwork the single white Apple sticker and there is no SIM card ejector tool here since they're all esim at least in the US now but most importantly the new cable in the iPhone box for all new iPhones is a single white braided USB C to usb-c Cable I think this is the first time the iPhone is shipping with a braided nice cable like this so hopefully it'll be a higher quality and more durable than gold cables we've been getting for years so cool USBC cable USBC phone now if we take a look at the plus same idea a bigger box but this new incredibly pale yellow I mean again in perfect lighting at the Apple event I think it looked a little bit more colorful but it just looks extremely pale out here and then we've got the pro boxes for the pro phones as well still White boxes but dark wallpapers so the iPhone 15 Pro I have here is the new dark blue color I almost want to call this one barely blue again but this time it's darker and kind of borders on Gray when the light hits it from certain angles very safe same stuff in the box after that though the paperwork the white Apple sticker and the new braided usb-c cable and then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here is the new natural titanium color and I gotta say guys I think this is going to be the one to get this it's the best color in person in the hand I'll talk more about why in a minute but there you have it the slightly new unboxing experience on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros so by the time you see this I've been testing these phones for about six days now not quite enough time for a review by my standards but still plenty of time to give you some interesting thoughts some things that I've picked up on and some quirks so first of all these pale colors I don't really know how else to say it like this might be totally fine with you I always get told everyone's gonna put a case on their phone which they probably probably are but hey Apple did spend a ton of time and money making this new softer touch satin finish on the back and some of us some of us will carry our phones around with no case so it's worth mentioning for the pro phones there's actually an extra layer of interesting though because they've switched that rail material the part that you actually touch on the outside from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium we've all heard about how much lighter it is and it's something like 10 lighter which is enough for me to notice and enjoy but the other thing is I thought the brushed finish would sort of eliminate fingerprints on the sides absolutely not I was wrong about that I mean it's less it's not as bad as stainless steel but especially on these darker colors like the black or this blue you can totally see fingerprints and sort of wear your hand oils are marking up the sides of the phone and then on top of that this is not anodized like aluminum might be this is the new PVD coating they talked about on stage and it's only been a week here for me and so I don't know exactly how well this will hold up over time but what I do know is if you get a scratch deep enough into this coating it's got to be the natural titanium color underneath which is very light and so that might look rough if you if you drop this phone with no case and get like a big gash on your dark colored phone and have light marks all over it all that to say I I do really think that this natural Titanium or the light is going to be the better color to get on the pros this year okay some things I've noticed in my first week so first of all on the pro the bezels are technically a little bit thinner which makes the buys a little smaller but you really don't notice that much after a few minutes what you do notice more actually visually is the slightly softer curves all the way around these phones seriously on the 15 and 15 Pro because on the 14 it was so square like it just went straight to the edge with a flat display and then it dropped right into the rail at 90 degrees on these new phones the edge of the front glass actually has a little bit of curve at the very edges so it's a softer curve into the rail then the rail itself has softer curves than the totally sharp corners from last year so I think it's a nice hybrid of making it just more comfortable in the hand with these curves but still keeping the generally boxy look now with USBC on these phones we already learned that you can just plug in a cable to charge an accessory right so you it's no reverse wireless charging but you can at least plug in a USBC cable straight to airpods or an Apple Watch magsafe charger whatever and it will charge from your phone's battery so that's all already pretty interesting but I decided it's worth learning all the rules and behaviors of plugging things into the iPhone 15s so here they are so if you plug in any older lightning iPhone into a USBC iPhone regardless of the charge State the USBC iPhone will always give battery to the lightning iPhone every single time no matter what now if you plug in another USBC iPhone into your USBC iPhone it actually does a handshake where they talk to each other figure out which one has the lower battery and then the one with the higher stated charge goes all right I'm a battery bank and I will start charging the one with the lower stated charge all the way till you unplug it so I thought that was pretty interesting and it works pretty well then I decided to try a couple of Android phones and see if the same handshake happened basically what we found is if you plug into your friend's Android phone who has more battery than you and that phone has USB PD it will actually act like a battery bank but if the phone doesn't have USB PD which is a bunch actually right now it's pretty inconsistent and you can end up charging it or it could end up charging you literally unplug and try it again but if it has USB power delivery it will actually do the same handshake that the iPhones do it's only four and a half Watts out so it's not huge it's not going to fast charge or anything but you know it is ideal for accessories you can literally use the cable in the Box to charge up the new airpods or whatever else you want to try but yeah you can rescue another smartphone in a pinch so then the new action button on the pros I was very curious about this I was I was not sure if it would have some restrictions or if there's some things that it wouldn't let you do and it turns out I haven't been able to find any so far it seems like it basically lets you do anything you want and I am very happy about that I mean this was a feature of a lot of Android phones in the past there were some LG phones that did this some Sony phones I want to say some Asus phones I'm hoping it starts to make a bit of a comeback here because on this new iPhone it is great so you jump into the settings and go to action button and it loads up this whole crazy UI that's just like nothing like any of the other settings pages on the iPhone like they just stapled this in here but okay and as I showed you in The Impressions video you can do any number of pre-programmed things with this button by default it is still the mute switch that it replaces and it has those two different haptic patterns so when you mute it in your pocket you know exactly what you're doing without even checking you did it correctly but honestly I don't know I leave my phone on mute most of the time anyway so you can also have it open up the camera in any of the camera modes but then again the camera shortcut is like right on your lock screen already and I'm pretty used to that same thing with the flashlight you could do that but it's also already on everyone's lock screen screen I like the voice memo trigger it's actually pretty convenient because it immediately starts recording when you press and hold the button but my favorite by a mile is the series shortcuts function because it basically lets you do anything else you can have it you can stack up a bunch of different functions that are like location dependent or you can have it call a certain contact or do certain things or if you just want to literally open any app on your phone with zero lag so it could be your to-do list app or your calendar app or just open YouTube with any one button press whatever you want for me I'm going to map my action button on my brand new iPhone to the Google Assistant the best assistant available on the iPhone also Apple if you're listening I also wish you could map a double press or a triple press of the action button to a new specific function just think about it also I was kind of curious how cases would handle this new action button so I asked Channel sponsor dbrand to send over their new ghost case and I have it here personally pretty solid I think this matte black skeleton design looks sick and yes I can confirm that even with the case the action button still feels nice and clicky now you might be thinking all right what's so special about this clear case I've seen a million clear cases and between the skeleton and magsafe if there's a bunch of other stuff but my favorite personally is if you've ever owned a clear case before you probably know that after a while it kind of ends up looking like this just disgusting and yellow but dbrand has promised me that they've specifically engineered the ghost case to be impossible to Yellow and they use those words themselves so they actually give you like a lifetime case replacement guarantee if it ever yellows so that's either a real promise or free cases for life the way I see it either way if you're interested I'll leave a link below the like button if you want to check it out that's the dbrand ghost case now I've also been taking some pictures and videos with these new cameras to get a sense of how they perform I will be taking many many more posting them on on Twitter if you want to follow me there Instagram as well I also fully plan on shooting the next autofocus car Channel video with this phone so you already know you can go subscribe over there to see how the video looks to hear how the microphones sound one thing that they did mention in the keynote specifically was there was a new coating over the lenses that I immediately thought oh does this fix the horrible night time flare issues with the iPhone's video first thing I did was go to a dark room bring it out at night shoot with some lights no it didn't fix it unfortunately I'm sure the coding does some other great stuff during the daytime but there's still flare issues sadly but also lastly I want to clarify the new camera behavior on the pro phones in The Impressions video I was a little down on the whole like 1X versus 1.2x for versus 1.5 x thing because I thought it was literally just a digital crop which would be pretty pointless to me but it's actually closer to a set of super res Zoom presets that you can actually then digitally Zoom between I'll detail all this in the full reviews and here's some benchmark scores in case you're curious about that sort of thing for performance for the a17 pro which is actually new uh but generally I think that wraps up my first Second Impressions my second look now that I got him in the studio really I feel like the base iPhone 15s if you're thinking if if you want to buy one of these or pre-order them it's a bigger Improvement than it seems on paper like nothing is actually new here but because it's bringing things from last year's Pro phone it's actually a very solid phone and then the pro it's a lot more interesting because there's some genuinely new stuff happening I've seen new stuff with the cameras also it seems like someone found out the batteries are slightly bigger across the board which is good too we'll see if that holds up but generally let me know what you want to see in the full reviews in the comment section below because I will be working on those over the next couple days and weeks and hopefully you'll see that soon either way thanks for watching catch in the next one face [Music]\",\n",
       " \"this is the iPhone 15 15 plus 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max I've flown all the way to Apple Park in California where I've gone Hands-On with the phones while also sitting down with some of Apple's major Executives so that I can give you everything you need to know the things I like and the things I don't like so let's start with the base 15 and 15 plus which have had three minor changes and three major ones from last year first being the design the iPhone 15s come in a whole Suite of pastely colors which are all pretty inoffensive I mean No One's Gonna Hate them but me personally I strongly prefer just proper vibrant confident colors as opposed to all this washed out off-white hoopla I remember seeing some rumors that there was going to be like a hot pink and a bubblegum blue and honestly that would have been awesome but what I am really glad about is these softer edges and the matte frosted finish on the back it may not be as cool as the very literal edginess on the last year's iPhones but I would take comfort any day you pick these phones up and instantly you notice this is like 200 more comfortable than the last phones and then the other minor but still very definitive Improvement is dynamic Island last year got it on the pro iPhones now we've got it on every iPhone and it doesn't fundamentally change the way you use your phone but I would say it's a combination of both a nicer aesthetic than the notch it just feels more futuristic and less like your phone's got a fringe they're the same picture with just a Sprinkle of nice to have features things like when you start a timer you can see the progress of that timer how when you order an Uber it'll tell you how many minutes till the Uber arrives funnily enough on my flight on the way here it was telling me the whole journey how much longer I had left to Landing time which is actually really convenient and the other perk of it is that it persists even when you move to other apps and so even though this Dynamic Island it isn't physically creating any new screen space it's the way that Apple has made the software around it that almost makes it behave like a secondary sub display within your main display that lets you do two things at once also the display itself is even brighter at up to 1600 nits or 2 000its if you're in direct sunlight if you haven't already used a 2000 display it's pretty staggering like it will not just be readable in broad daylight but actually bright there's a new Ultra wide bandship wideband being one of the ways that your iPhone communicates with your other Apple gadgets so the better chip basically means you can find your lost goods from further away and also your lost friends in case you're really bad at directions and it looks like the 15s are also getting a lot of the big camera upgrades of last year's top-end phones this is the first big change you know how Apple's used a 12 megapixel resolution main sensor for almost a decade now well it's gone in place of a bigger 48 megapixel sensor and thank goodness for that because yeah I mean Apple did Squeeze quite a lot out of the 12 megapixel sensor they had but it's only so far you can go and so with each of the last few Generations we really felt the pro iPhone stepping up and then the regular iPhones scraping together some very minor software improvements but clearly restrained by the limits of this week of Hardware so it's nice to see that limitation being lifted and also this 48 megapixel sensor has the side perk of letting you take two time zoom shots with far less of a quality hit than if we're still on the 12 minute pixel sensor and it means that in a lot of ways these base iPhone 15s are kind of like repackaged discounted versions of last year's 14 pros and that's not a bad thing if in one year what was previously Pro can become mainstream and that's progress and it does make this definitely feel like a bigger jump than what we saw last year between the 13 and the 14. although you are missing one key thing in the ultra fluid 120 hertz displays that the pros get these phones still have a standard 60hz refresh rate which feels slow to me because 120 hertz is what I'm used to but it may not bother you at all if that's what you're used to one more thing though and this is something I never really thought I wanted but now that I've seen it this is nearly as big of a deal to me as the actual camera upgrade itself when you shoot a photo with the 15 now your phone can capture depth information automatically which means you don't need to sit there and think what mode should I be in right now you just take the shot which means you can take the shot quicker and every single shot has the perk that afterwards you can go through and make it a portrait and even switch between the different focal points within that shot now I would guess that the reason they not done this sooner is that to do this your phone's got to capture a lot more information when it takes that photo and so it should take the phone longer and that would introduce some potential shutter lag and therefore blur in your shot this is going to need more testing on my end to see if Apple's managed to do it with no extra delay but that is what they're claiming but now it's time we talk about the elephant in the room the thing that the entire industry has been talking about for the last six months Apple has shifted from a lightning connector to a USBC or in other words they've shifted from a custom Apple made connector to the industry standard now it's not a secret that a big part of this is just Apple trying to get ahead of new EU rules which state that by 2024 all new smartphones need to be USBC to cut down on the unnecessary duplication of accessories and it might even be annoying in the short term if you have a bunch of accessories that are designed to work around lightning then they might well not work anymore but in the long term I think this is a pretty clear win on forefronts a it's better for the environment because from now on any smartphone accessory only needs to be made once and not in two separate versions it's about a customer experience because now you can get away with buying and carrying fewer cables as well as using whatever charger you want like I can actually feel the relief from the fact that when I now go places I can just take one power brick one cable and that will charge my MacBook my iPhone my Nintendo switch and even any Android whatever I'm carrying at the time this move is also going to reduce some of the force lock-in that people feel with Apple's ecosystem meaning that even if you use an iPhone you won't feel like you have to ditch every single accessory that you bought if you fancy trying an Android and then the final thing is that this is not just any USBC port at least on the pro iPhones this is a USB 3 Port which is not by any means unusual in the industry but it does mean that the transfer speeds are up to 10 gigabits per second which is a lot better it's like 20 times faster than lightning was what's not clear is if you're going to be able to get that maximum speed with the cable they ship you and also if you're going to be able to fully take advantage of it without using specifically made for iPhone accessories we'll find out it's quite funny because as they're announcing this I was just thinking to myself now it's just airpods left with a lightning connector and then they announced a set of airpods which also have USBC and I mean that is a pretty big ass to upgrade if you've just bought a lightning pair but it is good news if you've held off so far and then those airpods can be charged by your phone with the same cable that charges your phone which is good to have but it also feels pretty outdated given that most manufacturers can now wirelessly charge their earbuds and then the last big change for these base iPhones is the Chip And this is both kind of one of the biggest draws and one of the biggest drawbacks see every year up until 2022 when Apple's launched a set of phones all those phones were released with the same chip with potential slight modifications the A14 bionic the a15 bionic Etc but last year they started to separate the pros got the very latest a16 while the normal phones stuck with the same chip as the year before the a15 and so Wale is great that the base iPhones this year are getting an upgrade the normal 15s will now get the same a16 that the pros got last year and that it is let's be very clear a super fast chip that will not cause any performance problems what we're not getting is the very latest a17 that the 15 Pros have which basically means yeah this is a trend that we can just expect to see going forward that the pro phones will have not just better materials and better cameras and better display Tech but will also be the only way to actually get the latest internals too remember there's two ways to grow a company you can either increase the amount of customers which I'm sure apple is doing but it's a difficult Market to be doing that in or you can increase the average revenue per customer and I think this is what's happening with the iPhone right now I'm about to show you this in full force but the point is there has never been a bigger gap between Pro and non-pro as there is now with the iPhone 15s and the reason is to make it as much of a no-brainer as possible for a non-pro user to become a pro user because once you become a pro user once if you think about it you're going to stay a pro user you're going to keep buying the thousand dollar plus phones every time you upgrade and you're probably going to feel more bought into the ecosystem as a result like you might well think well I've already spent a grand on my phone I should probably get airpods Pro and if I get an iPad I should probably get the iPad Pro and ugh what's another ten dollars a month for some apple music too regardless of the strategy the iPhone 15 Pros pretty badass and for these there are six major things that we need to talk about the screen is using a brand new bit of tech that's allowed Apple to shrink the bezels to basically record-breaking levels to be clear some other phones do have Slimmer side bezels but from everything I've seen I don't think there's a phone that's achieved bezels like this while also having symmetry on all four sides and it's kind of a double win because anytime you manage to shrink the borders around your screen you get a choice you can either make the screen bigger and fit it into the same footprint or you can make your phone smaller with the same screen size which is exactly what Apple's done it's kind of like they've taken last year's iPhone 14 pro and just trimmed off the entire outer layer around the outside the phone is thicker than last generation though presumably to accommodate a bigger battery and so in a way it's actually really important that Apple's managed to do that trimming so that the phone doesn't feel bulky and then you've got the action button a button for which you can decide what it does which is something it seems like apple tested last year with the more Niche watch Ultra before now rolling out to the mainstream with the iPhone and my hot take is that I like it but I don't love it because I mean on one hand for me it's not taking away anything I never really used the ring silent switch because when I don't want to be disturbed by notifications I'd rather just go all the way into do not disturb and you can still use this action button to silence your phone but it's just that as well as that you can now also use it to open the camera to start a voice recording or what's really appealing to the hardcore Android customization freak inside of me is that you can also use it to trigger any of your Siri shortcuts which basically means any function of your phone so you could use it to open up Spotify you could use it to activate power saving mode which I could actually see myself doing quite a lot well you can even use it to vibrate your speakers at a specific frequency to clear out any water that's got into them my version of a good time but it's just there was also something nice about a slider that you could see what state it was in at a glance and that you can never accidentally trigger like you can with a button plus the key perk of an action button in my mind is that it is a faster more convenient way to trigger a command that you regularly use but one I'm holding my phone and I imagine when you're holding your phone my fingers are never all the way up here to be able to do that comfortably at that point it might actually be easier to just program multiple Taps of your power button to execute that same command I mean that is how I set up my iPhone 14 triple tap on the power button turns the screen grayscales but I do want to live with the action button first before I give any conclusive thoughts on it Apple has swapped materials on the pros from stainless steel to a titanium alloy now this is not the whole phone there's still the ceramic shield on the front and frosted glass on the back but what has changed is this enclosure in between and honestly titanium is great I mean it's even stronger than stainless steel which I mean I have dropped this phone probably six or seven times without a case directly on the floor each time I've had a mini heart attack and every time I've picked it up and been like no way there isn't a single permanent mark on the body so having something that's even stronger than that it's obviously a nice peace of mind but I think the thing that people will largely notice and appreciate more than that is the fact that titanium is also lighter the pro iPhone for a while now I've all been on the slightly too weighty for their size side so the reduced density that these bad boys have takes them to that really nice sweet spot where they still feel substantial like any pro phone should but without going so far that it's heavy it also means better thermal conduction out of the phone and we got these curved edges again ever since the day that Apple announced they were switching rounded sides for Sharp flat sides on their phones I've been counting down the days till they go back to having curves I mean it just makes sense your hand is not an angular object so neither should be the single device that you hold in your hand for the longest time so yeah I mean we took our time getting to this stage but boy am I glad we got here this phone feels amazing and it does so while not completely losing the core factor of having some sharpness to the design it's a bit of a shame that they didn't finish this all off with some more exciting unusual colors I mean a deep red wouldn't have hurt anyone but to be fair the silver this time is clean oh yeah there's a camera upgrade obviously there's a camera upgrade smartphones in 2023 so there's a slightly improved ultrawide camera and a big bigger sensor for the main camera which they're saying is going to make up to a two times difference to low light shots so we will definitely test that theory and also subtle little thing they only spent like three seconds in the event talking about it but they've also introduced a new coating to the camera which apparently reduces the amount of lens flares this is a top requested feature loads of people have asked for this but equally I don't think it has completely eliminated it based on my very quick testing 24 megapixels is now the Default Resolution output for the main camera which I know sounds a little underwhelming given that it is a 48 megapixel sensor but what's happened so far and what tends to happen with most companies who use high resolution cameras is that they take the shot at full resolution and then they down scale that resolution to have a cleaner but lower resolution output whereas this kind of makes it seem like apple is now confident enough in the image cleanliness already that they're no longer feeling like they need to reduce that resolution so much obviously Apple's example shots are very curated but they are showing levels of detail that the iPhone 14 in auto mode just could not do and then probably the biggest camera change is on the iPhone 14 pro Max only it's new telephoto lens we started off as a 2X it then became a 3X and now it is a five time zoom camera five is a lot of zoom and so I imagine the reason that we're not seeing this on the normal size Pro is space limitations and then they're pairing this new lens with better stabilization which is actually really important for higher magnifications because those lenses are much more prone to handshaking cool as it is though I do have some doubts like how there are other phones with 10 times optical zoom cameras which this probably won't outdo plus a big part of what makes Apple's portrait mode so great is that it uses the three-time zoom lens so you can sit further away from your subject and you get less distortion on their face but then if your only zoom camera is a five-time zoom camera there's probably too much magnification you'll most likely have to leave the room you're standing in to still fit them in the shot and so it seems like what they're going to do instead is to use the main 1X camera and to crop into that which kills the quality a little bit the only way you fix this problem is by having two Zoom cameras you have one high magnification Zoom when you want to properly get into something and then one much lower magnification one for the portraits last little camera tidbit is that the iPhone 15 Pros are going to be able to take spatial video basically 3D immersive video that you'll be able to properly watch and experience on an Apple Vision Pro headset it's very cool integration it's just not a cheap combo just before we get to pricing we've got to talk about one thing that I am really excited for and that is this a17 Pro chipset so keep because this is the first chip in the world to be based on a three nanometer process why is this a big deal well every other top engine in the world is based on a four nanometer process and basically the smaller that number the smaller the transistors that make up the chip if the transistors are smaller then they consume less power and you can have more of them and the cool thing about this is that proportionally speaking the jump between the four nanometer process and the three nanometer process is actually even bigger than the last major jump which was between five nanometer and four nanometer so basically you can expect a three nanometer chip to either run a lot faster if they use the extra space to cram in more transistors or Draw less power and produce less heat if they don't and it seems like based on Apple's stats that they're really pushing for the power efficiency angle which based on the iPhone 14s is exactly what I would have wanted them to do there's a pretty decent jump to the graphics power with support for Ray tracing and they did show some cool examples of console games that are making the jump to iPhone because of it which I'm all about but then beyond the examples that they showed I find it hard to believe that mass-market mobile game developers are actually going to get on board anytime soon and me can probably retrace games they also have a new Wi-Fi chip that'll let the pro phones connect to Wi-Fi 6E which if you have a 6E router is a big jump and a new 5G modem versus last year which should cut the power drain from connecting to mobile networks so yeah while the last iphone 14 series had good battery life it wasn't as good as the iPhone 13 series which really was chart topping but we will test this for ourselves so if you want to see that then a sub to the channel would be energizing then we've got the price this is the first year in a long time where we've had a price bump everything's the same except the pro Max which is now not just 100 more than the pro but 200. you do get more storage but this does put it very squarely up against other companies Ultra phones my first impression is that it probably does do enough to separate itself from the cheaper iPhones but that's what our detail tests are for see you there\",\n",

       " \"these are the iPhone 15s Apple talked about how they're the most power efficient phones ever including one claim that said they were up to three times more power efficient than their competitors but what they didn't mention is what that means for battery life so we're gonna go through a normal day of use to see how these new iPhones Stack Up and while that happens there's a few things about the batteries here that we need to talk about so first thing in the morning some breakfast tiktok disappointed in myself and let's just quickly go over what phones we're testing here so first the four new iPhones the 15 Pro Max which is now 11.99 the 9.99 15 Pro the 8.99 iPhone 15 plus and then the 799 base iPhone 15 and then as well as seeing how these new phones stack up against each other we're also going to be able to get a really cool bit of perspective because we have the iPhone 14 pro Max to see how the very best phone from this year will compare to the best phone from last year we have the base 14 to see how the base iPhones have changed from year to year and then of course the 13 Pro Max simply because that phone is the current world champion on the missed who's the boss battery test rankings so it's just there in case we break the record all right breakfast over and at this point I'll normally start getting ready for the day with my favorite Spotify playlist and this is quite an exciting result so far because the 15 Pro Max is in first place and it's trading blows with the current King the 13 Pro Max I would say that I care more about the battery on these iPhone 15s than I have on any other iPhone I've tested before for the simple fact that this is the first time that it's not just about you thanks to the long overdue USBC Port which cannot just receive but give power you can for the first time on an iPhone use any extra juice that you might have to charge your earphones to charge your watch or just other people's phones which means that it's not really the case anymore that as soon as you get a day's worth of battery that's plenty I'll take every drop I can get okay so we are two hours in now probably time to do some work so this is chat gbt4 it's the most current version of chat gbt let's ask it to do our work for us if you haven't played around with gbt4 by the way very fun tool like just as a joke I'm asking it right now to give a hundred reasons why cats are better than dogs and it's doing it so looking at the current percentages what's very exciting here is that the 15 Pro Max is just now ever so slightly edging out every single other phone on this test what's not as exciting is that the smaller Pro is in last place we're gonna dig into this in a minute because I have a theory but for now time for a zoo meeting with myself seven times yeah I normally sit next to these phones whenever we're battery testing just making notes and nursing them like children okay so why would the iPhone 15 Pro be performing worse than the iPhone 15 and more concerningly the iPhone 14. well firstly against the iPhone 15 I think part of it is just that Apple has made the iPhone 15s better for battery life and based on the spec sheet you actually have this weird situation where it seems like the base 15 also has a bigger battery capacity than the 15 Pro the thing that the pro has going for it is the pro motion display which has the ability to increase the phone's refresh rate all the way up to 120 hertz but importantly for battery to dial it all the way down to 10 Hertz when the app you're in doesn't need to be refreshing constantly but because in this test so far every app we've been in has had some sort of significant movement happening on screen at all times we haven't been able to reap the benefits of that but expect that to change as we go on okay after a two hour call with seven errands I need a break so let's open up the headspace meditation app and I want to explain another factor that I think is affecting the 15 Pros well obviously one thing is dynamic Island the 14 and the 13 Pro Max they don't have to worry about it I'd imagine it's not a massive battery drain but at the same time I'd be very surprised if it isn't contributing to at least some of the difference here because it's essentially one extra process that has to be running in the background at all times but what I think is the bigger thing is that the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max specifically are being powered by a brand new chipset the a17 pro the fact that it's a next generation three nanometer chip should mean pretty large power efficiency improvements that's the impression that I got when I watched the event especially since Apple explicitly mentioned that the iPhone 15 Pros had the most efficient CPU ever and that the efficiency cores in the chip which run when you're not doing anything particularly demanding are three times more efficient than the competition but then clearly in practice the battery gain is not as much as we initially thought it would be just because a lot of the extra Headroom generated by the efficiency is erased by the push to get more performance out of the chip now let's just quickly move on to cameras which is where I spend a lot of my time recording now this hits to power efficiency is not my ideal like I was saying earlier that with these phones in particular I want that battery but what does make me feel slightly better about this is that it looks like the battery life of the 15 series is still looking better than the battery life of the 14 series the 15 Pro Max is beating the 14 pro Max and the 13 Pro Max mind you and then the base 15 is absolutely destroying the base 14. and also just the fact that for the first time it looks like Apple's making a big push to try and create this exclusive lineup of console games that will also play on these iPhone 15 Pros there's only four games that have been officially promised so far but if that gets delivered on in a big way then that would be one of the few things that would make me okay with them prioritizing the bumping Graphics power instead of pushing for endurance from the last generation I suppose the other thing to bear in mind as we move on to YouTube which is usually where our content ends up after we film is that while it's easy to get caught up in the chips and how much they're improving from an efficiency standpoint the biggest effect on your battery life is going to be your screen and while display Tech is improving it just doesn't feel like it's improving quick enough to make a tangible difference between these Generations Okay so winding down the day now with some gaming but do you notice something very interesting that's kind of been happening under our eyes with these batteries we spent so much time talking about the pros that we've completely neglected the 15 plus which is now squarely in first place this is an impeccable performance ah I'm kind of torn about it though it's hard to be mad about crazy battery life but then at the same time if you're someone who's paid extra to have the pro experience is battery not part of that I'd consider myself a pro user and for me battery life is so vital that if a company came on stage one year with their phones and they just said we've made the battery last 30 longer they could drop the mic they could do nothing else and just walk off at that point and that would genuinely be enough for me to say that it was a success okay we've had our first casualty and we are about to have our second bear in mind that for this test Wi-Fi is on Bluetooth is on and the screen brightness is pretty high the phone speakers are off so obviously the exact amount of battery life that you get will vary but I've tried to calibrate it in a way that's more similar to a normal day in the life as opposed battery tests which have been on the heavier use side I can't believe how long this has been going on for I am genuinely exhausted but what makes me feel slightly better is that when I do hit the hay I can do so with my eight sleep pod after a pretty long trip to America it has a cover that fits over your bed like any fitted she eats and what you're seeing on these phones is the app that comes with it the key perk being it's temperature controlled it's set to my perfect temperature so I don't need to worry about having a loud fan next to my face and then as you go through the night it'll automatically adjust this temperature to make sure that your body hits all the important sleep stages and then it also tracks your sleep and gives you detailed stats about how you slept and how you can improve like this is mine from yesterday let's not dwell on that it shows me how much deep sleep I had and at what point I was awake and if you prefer a cooler temperature but you have a partner who likes to sleep on a stove you can set each side to different temperatures it's expensive but there's few things more worth investing in than your sleep I bought this myself a few years ago and genuinely to date it's been one of the best purchases I've ever made so I'll leave a link in the description and if you use the code boss you will get an extra 200 off okay time for the results so the iPhone 14 is in last place with 9 hours and two minutes it goes without saying that this is not bad battery life it's far more than you get on something like the iPhone SE and is enough for I would still say 80 of phone users then you've got the iPhone 15 Pro which did not last as long as I hoped and I expected it would likely the combination of a more power-hungry chip without the bigger battery capacity of the 15 Pro Max but equally I have been using this phone alongside a 14 pro and I found it consistently a little better which is to say it's plenty for most people but it's not the phone if you're a big power user it's almost quite funny then to see that next lasting over half an hour longer is the base iPhone 15. what do you think to this I mean it's obviously really good battery life for a base iPhone maybe the best ever but am I the only one who feels like if there's one thing that the pros should have over the base versions that it is battery next up then lasting basically an hour longer is the iPhone 14 pro Max I've used an iPhone 14 pro Max for the last year as my main phone and it's been I would say enough for my high powered needs almost all the time there's definitely been a couple of occasions where if it just lasted that extra five percent longer I could have made a phone call that I really needed to or got one more round of a game in before needing to charge but generally speaking I've had a good experience and then the 13 Pro Max which honestly has not once caused me problems I'm not surprised to see it in front of the 14 pro Max since that also reflects my day-to-day experience with the phone what that means though is that yes the 15 Pro Max is the best performing Max phone so far this is an extremely strong run that it's had and the result makes sense I mean the battery capacity on this Pro Max is a full 35 bigger than on the smaller Pro so the fact that it lasts 25 longer not a shocker and hey there's a little sprinkle on top I did also realize I left my Sim in this phone for the first few hours of this test which will make very minimal difference when on Wi-Fi but just for the sake of clarity it probably would have lasted an extra five minutes and then what I did not see coming the winner of this entire test and by far the longest score I've ever recorded slash had to sit through would be the 15 plus and do consider subscribing if you appreciate the effort this is actually such a lead over not just the phones that finished early but also the pro Max's for about 10 minutes after this test finished I was unironically just sitting there contemplating putting the 15 Pro Max in a drawer and switching to this this is absolutely absurd battery life and I am all for it\",\n",

Apple Vision Pro and its breakthrough spatial experiences with all of you now let's get to the big news of the day about Apple watch and iPhone their Innovative features and industry-leading Technologies help improve our lives in so many meaningful and delightful ways Apple watch helps us stay healthy active and connected an iPhone impacts just about everything we do they're with us all the time and if you left either one at home I bet you'd go back and get it so we're excited to talk about how we're taking Apple watch and iPhone even further let's get started with Apple watch here's Jeff to tell you more [Music] Apple watch helps millions of people live a better day it monitors your health motivates you to be active connects you to the people and information you care about and can even contact help if needed and today I'm excited to introduce the next generation of Apple [Music] [Music] watch Apple watch is the world's most popular watch and series 9 takes it to the next level with powerful new Apple silicon and amazing new features that you'll use every single day here's Dedra to tell you all about [Music] it Apple silicon Powers the incredible capabilities built into every Apple watch designing our own chips and tightly integrating them with watch OS unlocks Innovative features like Advanced Workout metrics sleep stages and car crash detection Apple Watch series 9 has been redesigned on the inside with the allnew S9 sip giving it a big boost in performance and capabilities it's our most powerful watch chip yet the S9 CPU has 5.6 billion transistors 60% more than series 8 and its GPU is 30% faster the new S9 chip makes the animations and effects in watch OS 10 look super smooth S9 also has a new four core neural engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast this powerful custom silicon is what allows us to maintain all day 18-hour battery life while adding new features and systemwide improvements to series 9 because it's always on you Apple watch is often the easiest and quickest way to use Siri to check the score close the garage or send a message just raise your wrist in ask it's that simple thanks to the powerful new neural engine Siri requests are now processed on device making them faster and more secure this means that the most common requests like Siri start an outdoor walk workout no longer have to go to the cloud so they can't be slowed down by a poor Wi-Fi or Cellular Connection and because the neural engine can run a more advanced Transformer model dictation on series 9 is up to 25 % more accurate than on series 8 secure on device processing also enables a brand new feature the ability to access your health data with Siri so now you can ask how much did I sleep last night what's my average walking heart rate or how does my mover ring look today and you can log Health Data like your weight or period or that you've taken your medications with just your voice Siri Health queries will be available later this year in English and Mandarin with more languages to follow Apple watch is perfect for interacting with nearby objects like smart locks gym equipment or payment terminals at home or out in the world your watch connects to all kinds of devices making so many of the things you do easier and with watch OS 10 you can use name drop to instantly share your contact information with another person's Apple watch this year Apple silicon enhances another one of our users favorite nearby or far away features the ability to Ping your iPhone series 9 has a new second generation Ultra wideband chip that enables Precision finding for iPhones with the same chip you'll see both the distance and direction to your iPhone and once you get close haptic and audible feedback guide you to its location even if it's in a different room Ultra wideband also brings new integration between Apple watch and homepod when you get close to your homepod media suggestions will a automatically appear at the top of the smart stack so you can instantly fire up a playlist or podcast or if audio is already playing your watch will launch now playing to let you control it series 9 features a big edgo Edge always on Retina Display that's even easier to read Outdoors because it now goes up to 2,000 nits double the brightness of series 8 the display is also better in very dark situations like a movie theater or early morning wakeup because it now goes to down to just one knit these features will be useful every time you put on your watch but that's not all the powerful zip also enables an incredible new capability back to Jeff to tell you about it Innovations on Apple watch like the digital crown and taptic engine along with tap swipe and double click make it simple and intuitive to use Apple watch is also controlled by gestures like wrist rays which brighten the display to let you check the time read notifications or see who's calling with a glance you can even cover the display to silence alerts today we're adding something really cool series non enables an incredible new gesture that uses just your watch hand it's especially convenient for those common situations when your other hand is occupied like walking the dog or holding a cup of coffee we think you'll use this all the time introducing double tap just tap your index finger and thumb together twice it's that easy you can use double tap to answer a call let me show you hi Dedra hey Jeff this same gesture also works to end a call see you later okay bye double tap controls the primary button in an app so you can use it to stop a timer play and pause music or snooze an alarm a double tap will also launch the smart stack from your watch face double tap again to scroll through the widgets just like turning the digital Crown this new gesture is enabled by the powerful neural engine in series 9 which processes data from the accelerometer gyroscope and Optical heart sensor in a complete completely new way it uses a machine learning algorithm to detect the unique signature of tiny movements and changes and blood flow when your hand and fingers perform a double tap check out double tap in [Music] action hello the up hello hello every I feeling my power yeah every tou feeling my [Music] power buy the books but I don't know what books you're talking about I don't know Tina I thought I was on the third floor but I saw a sign that it was second floor and then I try to get every little that I touch it's feeling my [Music] power double tap makes interacting with your watch faster easier and more convenient it will be available next month and we can't wait for you to start using it because once you do it will become one of those magical experiences you rely on every day series 9 will be available in a gorgeous new pink aluminum case plus Starlight silver midnight and product red and stainless steel cases in Gold Silver and graphite across these models we've also been innovating in another important direction towards our industry-leading environmental goals we recently had the chance to share our progress with a special guest welcome to app welcome to app hi I'm be how is the weather coming in yeah I'm going to do the offices already Caron neutral thing right yeah all [Music] yours okay I hope we didn't keep you [Music] waiting mother nature mother nature welcome to Apple how how was the weather getting in the weather was however I wanted it to be let's cut to the chase in 2020 you promised to bring Apple's entire carbon footprint to Zero by 2030 Henry David the row over here said we have a profound opportunity to build a more sustainable future for the planet we share I think our 10:00 said the same thing they all do all right this is my third corporate responsib ability gig today so who wants to disappoint me first well we've got some updates we're excited to share with you materials status is there a materials person here yes we are in the process of eliminating all plastic from our packaging by the end let me guess 50 years from now when someone else is left holding the bag by the end of next year actually when we're also currently using 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosures of all our MacBooks Apple TVs Apple watch what about iPod Shuffle well it's a joke don't you people make Ted lasso well that's a different group um we're also phasing out leather in our iPhone cases what about Brando over there they phasing you out too oh what's next electricity electricity status uh uh uh we're operating on 100% clean electricity what runs on 100% clean electricity every Apple office store and data center runs on clean electricity thanks to you and your powerful wind and and sun and apple offices are already carbon neutral yeah this building is carbon neutral oh yeah we we do it with the mix of clean energy and eliminating Greenhouse emissions it's kind of like if you were to seriously explaining carbon neutrality to Mother Nature right no I'm sorry you want to tell me how photosynthesis works too don't um also over 300 suppliers have committed to using 100% clean renewable electricity what's next Transportation I'm proud to report that we're shipping more products by ocean rather than air which reduces Transportation emissions by 95% 95% not too bad I'm also happy to report that we're investing in projects around the world that protect the Earth's soil plants and trees everyone says they're planting trees we've planted forests oh hello where Paraguay Brazil what are you trying to save the tropical savannah yes and we've also restored mangroves in Colombia what else grasslands in Kenya why our aim is to permanently remove carbon from the [Music] atmosphere what about your water usage we've reduced it by how much 63 billion gallons 63 million billion [Music] as you can see we've innovated and retooled almost every part of our process to reduce our impact on the planet by 2030 all Apple devices will have a net zero climate impact all of them all of them they better they will [Music] okay good see you next year don't disappoint your [Music] mother [Music] awesome as you can see we've been working on some really big environmental initiatives and it's making a difference to share more here's [Music] Lisa at Apple our mission is to make products customers love and protect the planet at the same time 3 years ago we made our corpor corate operations around the world carbon neutral it was the first step towards our most ambitious environmental commitment to date Apple 2030 our plan to be carbon neutral across our entire business by the year 20130 the next step is getting the carbon footprint of all of our products down to Net Zero for Apple Watch series 9 we challenged ourselves to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their three biggest sources materials electricity and transportation maximizing recycled and renewable materials in our products is key to Apple 2030 because they have a lower carbon impact than virgin materials so we use 100% recycled aluminum in our watch cases plus recycled gold tin copper tungsten and more inside of series 9 and for the first time there is 100% recycled Cobalt in the battery we also redesigned one of our most popular watchbands the sport Loop to use more recycled material it is now made with 82% recycled yarn while maintaining the softness and comfort you love electricity is the biggest source of carbon emissions since 2015 we've been investing in renewable energy like this solar installation in central California while helping suppliers do the same and we're excited to announce that starting this year all Apple watch manufacturing is powered by 100% clean electricity charging is another source of emissions while it's a small amount per person across millions of watch wearers it adds up so we decided to do something about it for series 9 Apple will match 100% of your expected electricity use by investing in renewable energy projects around the world finally we looked at how Apple watch gets from the factory to you to cut a missions from transportation we started by redesigning series 9 packaging to be 100% fiber-based And More compact it has a new smaller shape that lets us ship up to 25% more watches per trip and more of those trips will be made with low carbon shipping modes like ocean Freight which emits just 120 of shipping by air our efforts to reduce emissions from materials electricity and transportation resulted in a whopping 78% decrease in the carbon footprint the small amount of emissions that remain are offset by high quality credits from projects like forests and wetlands that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere this last step brings the net carbon footprint of Apple Watch series 9 down to zero making it at our first ever carbon neutral product any combination of aluminum series 9 and new sport Loop is carbon neutal and has been certified by an independent third party to help you recognize it you'll see this new logo on the box we are so excited about this achievement and it's how we plan to get all Apple products to carbon neutral by innovating across design engineering and operations to steeply reduce emissions for applying high quality carbon credits while Apple 2030 is the destination the journey is important too so we looked for additional opportunities to make change leather is a popular material for accessories but it has a significant carbon footprint especially at Apple scale to reduce our impact we will no longer use leather in any new Apple product including watchbands and that starts today now back to Jeff to tell you more we've developed a beautiful luxurious and durable new textile that we're calling fine woven it's made of 68% postc consumer recycled content which has a significantly lower carbon footprint Than Leather fine woven gives the new magnetic link a subtle luster and sued likee feel and it looks great on the modern Buckle too both bands will be available in new colors and offer a sophisticated look for any special occasion we also explored more environmentally friendly materials with our partners this year we collaborated with our MZ on four new styles that draw on their long history in textiles there are two elegant woven bands our first ever knitted band and another in sporty molded Rubber and all come in a range of Rich colors heres radial a modern take on their classic watch face complements these Innovative new styles we also worked with Nike to design new bands that repurpose excess materials and waste reducing the use of Virgin material the new Nike sport band includes colorful flakes of recycled material they create a randomized pattern that makes each band unique for the Nike sport Loop we repurposed yarn from previous Seasons to make the same soft material with a fun new space die look both bands come in a range of dynamic colors and there's a new Nike watch face that shows each passing second on the lines of the globe and that's the new Apple watch series 9 it features a magical new way to control your watch with double tap faster on device Siri that lets you securely Access Health Data Precision finding for iPhone and a brighter display all enabled by the S9 sip our most powerful chip ever in Apple watch and it's Apple's first ever carbon neutral product now let's talk about Apple watch [Music] Ultra Ultra is the most advanced Apple watch and it's perfect for anyone who wants the biggest display and longest battery life with a stunning design over the last year Ultra has helped people accomplish extraordinary Feats like summiting the tallest mountains completing demanding endurance races and Diving the world's oceans Ultra is a Precision Tool designed to go farther higher and deeper than any Apple watch has before and we've made our most rugged and capable Apple watch even better today we're introducing Apple watch Ultra 2 with Incredible new features that elevate any adventure and here's Daniela to tell you all about it Ultra 2 gets the powerful new S9 SI that means you can use the new double tap gesture anytime your hands are full set a waypoint using just your voice with the new on device Siri even when you have no connectivity and precision finding with the second generation Ultra wideband chip helps you easily find your iPhone phone when you can't remember where it's stowed Ultra 2 also has a new Advanced display architecture that pushes the brightness to a massive 3,000 nits it's the brightest display Apple has ever created and makes Ultra 2 more readable in the harshest sunlight to take advantage of this incredible display we created an exclusive new watch face called modular Ultra it's the first to use the outermost edge of the display to show realtime data like altitude depth or the passing seconds modular Ultra can be customized to provide the most information at a glance of any digital watch face we have ever made and now night mode uses the ambient light sensor to activate automatically in the dark day or night Ultra has so much to offer and for runners it's the perfect choice with Advanced metrics a big brighter display a customizable action button and precision dual frequency GPS and this year watchos 10 take cycling to the next level allowing you to connect Bluetooth

as a live activity on your iPhone Ultra 2 is designed for extremes and has been tested across the largest range of altitudes for any Apple product from the lowest valleys to the highest peaks Ultra is also great for your underwater adventures the depth app now saves a log of each session so you can review your Dives right on Ultra and in the fitness app on iPhone from Alpine Peaks to deep water to the open road we can't wait to see where you take Ultra 2 now back to [Music] Jeff even with all these new capabilities Ultra 2 still gets the same great battery life up to 36 hours of typical use on a single charge and up to 72 hours in low power mode with ultra 2 we are also continuing our commitment to the environment in just one year we significantly increased the amount of recycled content in the case going from all virgin titanium to 95% recycl this dramatic Improvement in material along with our work in clean electricity and transportation allowed us to meet our ambitious carbon reduction targets making any Ultra 2 paired with an Alpine Loop or Trail Loop carbon neutral and this year the Trail Loop and Alpine Loop and The Ocean band come in a range of beautiful new colors and that's the new Apple watch Ultra 2 it comes with all the features users love about Ultra Plus the powerful S9 sip Apple's brightest display ever an expanded altitude range on device Siri and a brand new gesture for easy control of your watch these Innovations and the advancements in watch OS 10 make our most rugged and capable watch even better Ultra 2 joins series 9 in the lineup along with the popular second generation Apple watch SE and we're excited to announced that se is also carbon neutral when paired with a sport Loop which means this fall customers can buy a carbon neutral model of any new Apple watch the Apple watch SE starts at just $249 the new series 9 starts at 3.99 and Apple watch Ultra 2 is $7.99 you can order the new Apple watch models starting today and they will be available on September 22nd now back to [Music] Tim I love the new Apple watch series 9 and Apple watch Ultra 2 with Incredible new capabilities they're the most technically Advanced watches we've ever created and I'm really proud of the Apple Watch Team for delivering our first carbon neutral product 7 years ahead of our companywide 2030 goal now let's talk about iPhone since the very first iPhone we focused on giving our users a device that's incredibly powerful remarkably easy to use and beautifully designed every year we've built on this Foundation to create experiences that make a real difference in our users daily lives today we're pushing what users love about iPhone even further and I'd like to show it to you [Music] now yes Lord we G that's St I feel we're gone o we [Music] G iPhone 15 is absolutely incredible to tell you all about it here's [Music] Cayenne iPhone 15 has an all new design that's simply gorgeous starting from the front it has the dynamic Island which has been a hit with our Pro users the dynamic Island fluidly expands and adapts to your alerts and live activities creating an experience that's so intuitive it feels magical now even more users ERS can easily control their music or see the next Direction in maps our amazing community of developers have made the dynamic Island even more useful by expanding what it can do now you can track a pizza delivery and follow the big game at the same time when you're catching a flight you can see which gate you're leaving from and how long until boarding time it's more helpful than ever and the dynamic Island looks fantastic on this super Retina xdr Display which uses OLED technology it provides an exceptional viewing experience with thinner borders Rich color and support for Dolby vision and now it's even brighter Peak HDR brightness reaches 1,600 nits so hdr photos and videos will look better than ever when it's sunny Peak brightness can now go up to 2,000 knits twice as bright as iPhone 14 it comes in two sizes 6.1 in for iPhone 15 and 6.7 in for iPhone 15 plus the larger display of iPhone 15 plus gives you more space for text when you're reading the latest article post or message and the bigger display is perfect when you choose larger texts both sizes feel even nicer in your hand due to a new contoured Edge on the Aerospace grade aluminum enclosure for the first time ever in a smartphone iPhone 15 has color embedded throughout a single piece of durable color infused glass we use metallic ions to build color into the foundation of the material itself precisely controlling the saturation to create five stunning colors pink yellow green blue and black to provide the durability our users depend on we optimized our custom dual ion exchange process for this new material and Polished it with nanoc crystalin particles then it's etched to create a textured matte finish that feels incredible iPhone 15 has ceramic Shield tougher than any smartphone glass and water and dust resistance so it's built to last an iPhone holds its value longer than any other smartphone this is good for our users and good for the environment since it helps conserve finite natural resources another key part of reaching our goal of carbon neutral products by 2030 is maximizing our use of recycled content as you heard from Lisa earlier the enclosure uses 75% recycled aluminum for the first time we're using 100% recycled cobolt in the battery and 100% recycled copper foil in the main logic board and mag safe charger iPhone 15 has an entirely new Advanced Camera system it is designed to help our users take fantastic photos of everyday moments in their lives we're always looking for ways to make it easier for everyone to take gorgeous photos so we're bringing an amazing 48 megapixel main camera to iPhone 15 it's built for shooting Sharp Photo phot and videos every day with a quad pixel sensor and 100% Focus pixels for fast autofocus this 48 megapixel camera opens up some exciting capabilities say you're outside on a bright sunny day you can maximize resolution with a 48 megapixel photo like this Majestic landscape which captures the fine details of the mountains the Rolling Hills and even the individual shingles on the houses of course most of the time it's best to balance detail and light capture so we use computational photography to take the main camera to the next level the sensor groups every four pixels together into a larger 2 Micron pixel for fantastic light capture then photonic engine takes the image that's been optimized for light capture and combines it with a super highresolution image for Rich details the result is a 24 megapixel photo with Incredible image quality and double the resolution it perfectly balances light and detail and has a practical file size that's great for storing and sharing and with all these pixels we can do more than increase the resolution using the middle 12 megapixels of the sensor we enabled a new 2x telephoto option for capturing photos and 4K video with Optical quality it's like having a third camera it helps you feel closer to the scene and because it's enabled by the main camera it has the same f1.6 aperture and sensor shift Optical image stabilization which helps you take fantastic photos even in low light you can zoom out to capture the whole scene or zoom in for the perfect closeup all with Optical quality when you're shooting videos the 2x telephone photo also has continuous Zoom so you can frame the scene like here in 4k cinematic mode it helps you feel closer to your subject so it's perfect for portraits which are getting even better to tell you more here's [Music] maram this year we're introducing the next generation of portraits on iPhone now it's even easier to to get stunning portraits of your friends and family portraits will get richer color and great lowlight performance like this one it's full of vivid color and detail and it uses a rich depth map to create a beautiful boka effect in this portrait of a very good dog asking for a treat iPhone cut the perfect moment with zero shutter lag a spit second later and it just wouldn't be the same and it's easier to take a portrait because now you don't have to remember to switch to portrait mode using machine learning we can detect when there's a person in the frame and capture Rich depth information automatically so you can turn it into a stunning portrait right away or later on in the photos app it even works with dogs and cats so you can have more portraits in your pets album in iOS 17 automatically and with a rich depth map we're introducing focus and depth control for a whole new level of creative control take this super high resolution portrait now you can switch the focus from one subject to another after the photo has been taken it gives you so many more options with your photos and less to think about in the moment when it's dark night mode is getting better too like in this photo which was taken outside it has sharp details and vibrant colors so it beautifully captures the texture of his skin individual strands of hair and even the shadows of leaves in his shirt when lighting is bright or uneven the latest smart HDR captures both the sky and your subject with Vivid colors and even more true to life rendering of skin tones look at this colorful selfie shot on the true depth front camera it uses our new smart HDR to beautifully capture the Deep shades of purple in her shirt and the bright red of the chair behind her when you're looking at HDR photos in the photos app they'll have brighter highlights with richer midtones so you can really see the rich shades of her dress and how the light hits her cheek just the way it was in real life by combining Advanced computational photography with the 48 megapixel main camera Ultra wide camera and trueth front camera iPhone 15 makes it easy to take great looking photos and videos every day and it's all powered by Apple silicon back to Cayenne [Music] to deliver all of these Advanced features iPhone 15 has an incredible chip a16 bionic it was introduced on iPhone 14 pro and it's proven how powerful fast and efficient it is the Custom Image signal processor enables the advanced camera system so you can capture fantastic highresolution photos and videos the 16 core neural engine handles everything from computational photography to live voicemail transcriptions on device in order to protect your privacy the five core GPU has 50% more memory bandwidth than a15 bionic so it's even better for graphics intensive games and the six core CPU has two high performance cores which are faster and use 20% less power than a15 Bionic the four high efficiency cores can handle most daily tasks so even with all of the new features iPhone 15 still has all day battery life an iPhone 15 plus has a bigger battery that lasts even longer for those days when you forget to charge or just want to spend more time gaming browsing the web or on FaceTime with your friends now let's talk about connectivity iPhone 15 uses uses powerful wired and wireless Technologies to tell you about the exciting new wireless features coming to iPhone 15 here's Dennis iPhone uses Wireless Technologies to make everyday activities easier like streaming videos with AirPlay or easily sharing contact information with Nam drop using near field communication iPhone was the first smartphone with ultra wideband which is great for identifying where your keys are hiding in the couch Ultra wideband is getting even better this year because just like Apple watch iPhone 15 has our Cutting Edge second generation Ultra wideband chip so iPhone 15 can connect to other devices with this chip from up to three times farther away this chip also opens up a completely new way to use Precision finding on iPhone 15 to find your friends when when you're in a crowded place like a train station or a farmer market and your friends share their location you'll be guided right to them with clear directions and distance it's built into fi so it has all the same privacy protections that users have come to trust of course sometimes a phone call is the best way to reach someone iPhone already has fantastic 5G performance and now audio quality on phone calls is getting better too because iPhone 15 uses a more Advanced machine learning model that automatically prioritizes your voice if you prefer to filter out even more distracting background noise just select voice isolation and you'll come through loud and clear I'm at the farmers market do you want hang on it's noisy here better great of course they have apples here it's a feature you can use every day [Music] sometimes a call can't go through because you're off the grid when you need help in an emergency iPhone introduced a breakthrough new service emergency SOS via satellite it's having an extraordinary impact including helping First Responders rescue people after accidents and natural disasters and users have let their loved ones know that they're safe by updating their location with fine my viia satellite in places from the Shetland Islands in Scotland to Mount Wellington in Tasmania emergency SOS and find my viia satellite have expanded to 14 countries on three continents and they're coming to Spain and Switzerland this month emergency SOS was built for serious emergencies that require a first responder but say you have car trouble and no cellular or Wi-Fi service for those times we're introducing roadside assistance via satellite it's been built on the same advanced technology as our existing satellite service and it's so easy to use just text roadside assistance and select what kind of help you need then the intuitive interface will guide you to connect

combination of powerful techn technology ease of use and thoughtful design make them indispensable and we're not done yet our PR models represent the very best of Apple Innovations advancing features across design camera performance and more the Next Generation Pro pushes each of these further in ways only Apple can and I'd like to introduce it to you now he for a closer look at iPhone 15 Pro the most Pro iPhone we've ever created here's [Music] Jaws iPhone 15 Pro is packed with industry first Innovations and features our users are going to love powered by our most advanced Apple silicon yet it delivers the most incredible photos and videos and we are thrilled to introduce our astonishing new titanium Design This is the most premium material we've ever used in an iPhone enclosure titanium is incredibly strong and durable yet at the same time it is much lighter making these our lightest Pro Models ever you'll feel it as soon as you pick it up titanium is just just beautiful it feels fantastic with the new contoured edges and we're also introducing the thinnest borders ever on an iPhone this enabled us to reduce iPhone Dimensions without affecting the display size so together with the lighter weight and new edges iPhone 15 Pro is a delight to hold in your hand in addition to the strength of titanium iPhone 15 pro has the toughest glass-based materials in the industry including the ceramic Shield front which is only available on iPhone and there are two great display sizes to choose from 6.1 in for iPhone 15 Pro and 6.7 in for iPhone 15 Pro Max now to tell you more about this incredible titanium design here's [Music] Isabelle every material we choose for iPhone is meticulously considered for iPhone 15 Pro Pro we re-evaluated every structural component inside and out optimizing our alloy selection and creating a breakthrough innovation in manufacturing and materials design the new enclosure uses grade five titanium an alloy that has even higher tensil strength than pure titanium it's typically reserved for applications where the balance of strength formability as well as weight are especially critical in fact this is the same alloy used on the Mars rover titanium has one of the highest strength to weight ratios of any metal providing incredible durability for iPhone while enabling a much lighter design in comparison to stainless steel the titanium encases a new aluminum substructure that is bonded using solid state diffusion this is an industry first Innovation using a new thermomechanical process that joins these two metals with Incredible high strength using aluminum on the inside creates synergistic properties with the titanium enclosure helping with thermal dissipation and further weight reduction titanium also introduces a new refined brush texture enabled by a unique multi-step process that includes Precision Machining sanding brushing and Blasting and while anodizing is commonly used on titanium we chose to use a PVD coating as added protection while introducing color these apple design Coatings are engineered with nanometer precision and take up to 14 hours to complete resulting in four gorgeous finishes black titanium and white titanium beautifully harmonize with the back glass blue titanium highlights the material's elegance and natural titanium celebrates its raw metallic nature there is also a new internal chassis architecture that makes iPhone more repairable thanks to a new structural frame that allows the back glass to be easily replaced the entire aluminum substructure is made with 100% recycled aluminum a first for iPhone contributing to the overall increase in recycled materials as we work toward our 2030 goals now back to Jaws there's another design change for iPhone 15 Pro that we're really excited about from the very first iPhone we've had the ring silent switch a quick and easy way to to mute iPhone sounds we wanted to make this even better so with iPhone 15 Pro we are Reinventing the experience with a customizable action button by default it's still a simple ring silent switch to toggle between ring and Silent you simply press and hold the button to confirm your intent you also feel a distinctive haptic feedback for each state and you can choose from a set of actions and easily switch between them for example with a simple press you can start voice memos to quickly record a new idea or launch camera to capture that important moment activate a favorite accessibility feature like live speech or you can use shortcuts to open up an even wider set of options from Simply launching your favorite app to running your own custom shortcuts the action button delivers even more convenience and versatility to the iPhone experience and every interaction gives you visual feedback with the dynamic Island on the advanced Pro display of iPhone 15 Pro in addition to the Innovative Dynamic Island the super Retina xdr Display also provides the smooth performance of promotion the brightness and color of extreme dynamic range and the convenience of the alwayson display and with iOS 17 we're introducing standby a new full screen experi experience activate it by turning your iPhone on its side while it's charging with the always on display of iPhone 15 Pro standby stays on persistently to show you useful information perfect on a nightstand kitchen counter or desk you can choose a simple digital clock or customize your view with multiple widgets iPhone 15 Pro also includes a huge advancement in performance we are excited to introduce Next Level performance and more Pro capabilities than ever with the A7 Pro for more on how this marks the beginning of a new chapter in iPhone performance here's [Music] Shri the a series triip Powers every experience on iPhone for iPhone 15 Pro we developed a new generation of Apple silicon that is a major step forward with changes throughout the entire chip including a breakthrough new GPU at the foundation of this new chip is the transistor technology and this is the industry's first 3 nanometer chip these 3 nanomer transistors are patterned using state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet lithography elements of these transistors are just over 12 silicon atoms wide A7 Pro features 19 billion of these transistors and we use all of them to improve the performance efficiency and features of our new chip the new CPU features microarchitectural and design improvements for both our performance cores and efficiency cores our performance cores are now up to 10% faster continuing to deliver the fastest single-threaded performance in any smartphone challenging even high-end desktop PCS our efficiency cores are also faster and remain unmatched in the industry delivering three times the performance per wat of the competition these are critical to iPhone as your most typical tasks run on these cores the neural engine is now up to twice as fast for machine learning models allowing it to process up to 35 trillion operations per second the neural engine uses machine learning on device without sending your personal data to the cloud powering features like typing more accurately with auto correct lifting a subject from a photo background or creating a personal voice for users at risk of speech loss A7 pro has dedicated engines that enable Pro features those include the prores codec and a display engine that powers Pro motion and the always on display we also included a dedicated av1 decoder enabling more efficient and highquality video experiences for streaming services iPhone 15 Pro also has the new USBC connector but for our Pro Models we included a new USB controller an a17 Pro that enables new workflows not possible before this is the first iPhone with USB 3 speeds up to 10 GBS per second using an optional USB 3 cable that's up to 20 times faster than USB 2 enabling much higher transfer speeds the groundbreaking innovation of A7 Pro is a brand new GPU with a new Apple design Shader architecture our biggest redesign in the history of Apple gpus this is a proclass GPU that expands what's possible on iPhone even more we focused on three things improving performance and efficiency running complex applications and adding new rendering features the new GPU is now a six-core design which is up to 20% faster for Peak Performance and we also focused on Energy Efficiency that helps with sustained performance for games we've added brand new features to the GPU like mesh saing which lets games create detailed environments while drawing less power and for the first time we have Hardware accelerated raate tracing featuring the fastest raate tracing performance in any smartphone here's a scene without rate tracing that instead uses Cube maps to approximate the reflections on surfaces the light reflecting in the scene is less accurate and thus less realistic now here's a scene with rate Trace Reflections more accurately representing the behavior of light and reflections of the environment with Hardware accelerated rate tracing A7 Pro can run these Graphics smoothly at much higher frame rates than with software-based rate tracing it's a more immersive experience for games and AR applications A7 Pro is more energy efficient and can run up to four times faster when compared with software-based rate tracing on a16 bionic gaming is further improved with new software features including metal FX upscaling which combines the performance of the GPU and neural engine to enable high quality Graphics while using much less power with the fastest trip ever on any smartphone we are excited for iPhone 15 Pro to change Mobile gaming back to Jaws to tell you more iPhone is the best mobile gaming platform in the world iPhone is powered by high performance and and power efficient Apple silicon features Advanced HDR displays supports variable refresh rates and is compatible with the most advanced game controllers the App Store and apple arcade have revolutionized game distribution and iPhone and iOS have a fantastic game developer Community A7 Pro takes this incredible platform even further laying the foundation for a new generation of mobile gaming some of the world's best game developers are taking advantage of this new level of performance here's a taste of what's possible on iPhone 15 Pro Welcome to New York City in the division [Music] resurgam the A7 Pro allows us to push the quality of the game with improved resolution more Dynamic lightings and even more fire and weather effects making the game more real thanks to the chip updates we have been able to develop high quality water features that means more realistic waves and Reflections on the new iPhone 15 Pro hon Kario has never looked better upscaling but that's not all games like Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 4 Once only available on consoles can now be played on iPhone thanks to a17 [Music] Pro this is the future of mobile gaming all thanks to the power of iPhone 15 [Music] Pro [Applause] wow it's amazing to think those games are running on a device that fits in your pocket we're excited that the division Resurgence is launching an iPhone in early 2024 and this new level of performance will enable new games for iPhone 15 Pro that were previously only available on game consoles PCS or the Mac by capcom's Resident Evil Village and the remake of resident Evil 4 both launching later this year and Ubisoft will bring Mirage the latest installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise to iPhone 15 Pro in early 2024 this is the first time the console version of Assassin's Creed will be natively available on a smartphone now let's talk about the camera the pro camera system is a big reason why users choose our Pro Models built on a powerful Foundation of hardware and software it captures the most amazing photos and videos with the incredible versatility of multiple lenses iPhone 15 pro has our best camera system yet users will get even better photos and videos powerful new features and the equivalent of seven camera lenses in their pocket to tell you how we achieve this here's [Music] Misha [Music] last year we introduced our Innovative 48 megapixel camera which users love for their beautiful high resolution photos iPhone 15 Pro features a more advanced 48 megapix Main camera with an even larger sensor than iPhone 15 the camera includes a new nanoscale coating to reduce lens flare brings high resolution to Everyday photo photos enables more focal lengths and has better low light performance for portraits and night mode when using all pixels of the Quad pixel sensor the main camera can capture unbelievable detail like every little scale in this lizard in addition to 48 megapix Pro raw users can now shoot in 48 megapix Heath with four times more resolution than before and with the power of our computational photography we have the new super high resolution defa for the main camera 24 megapixel photos merge the best of low light and detail together as you can see here in the beautiful color of her eyes the sharpness on the edges of her clothes and the artistic reflection on the table since the new photonic engine now uses a 48 megapixel image iPhone can shoot higher resolution photos in 24 28 and 35 mm focal length a very important range for pro photographers they can Now quickly switch between these new options and even choose a new default lens customizing their camera experience to their creative needs iPhone 15 Pro also gets Next Generation portraits with focus and depth control with two times better low light performance as you can see here in this beautiful shot the smallest details of her expression are incredibly clear and contrasted with a dimly LD yet detailed background you can really feel her emotion in this photo night mode is unbelievable now powered by the photonic engine we can capture more color and details than ever from the warmth of her lipstick to the creases of her white dress enabled by the lar scanner night mode portraits also look stunning on iPhone 15 Pro in this shot we captured the intricate fabric of his sweater to together with a beautiful Boke of the lights in the background and our latest smart HDR delivers even more true to life photos with greater dynamic range as you can see here with the beautiful Lighting on her face and the sun reflecting on her hair all while preserving the blue of the sky now let's talk about our Zoom range iPhone 15 Pro features a great 3x telephoto camera at 77 mm focal length ideal for classic portraiture for iPhone 15 Pro Max we're using the extra size of the larger iPhone to introduce something unique our longest optical zoom yet 5x optical zoom at 120 mm focal length we designed a stateof the telephoto camera compared to iPhone 14 pro Max it has a 25% larger sensor 100% Focus pixels and an f2.8 aperture the largest of any smartphone phone at this Optical range 120 mm is a very useful focal length great for close-ups Wildlife photos and getting closer to the Sports Action 120 mm lenses are typically long so instead we created an Innovative tetr prism design built right into iPhone the light rays are reflected four times through the glass structure allowing the light to travel for longer in a much smaller Design This creates enough separation between the lens and the sensor to enable the longer focal length and we have our most advanced stabilization yet a combined ois and autofocus 3D sensor shift module that moves in all three directions a first for any smartphone this was critical to support the tetr prism design it provides even better stabilization with up to 10 ,000 micro adjustments per second that's twice as many as iPhone 14 pro this longer focal length gives Pro users a brand new creative option and we can't wait to see the incredible photos they will take the ultrawide camera is also improved with a new anti-reflective coding better night mode and the latest smart HDR in addition to enabling one of our users favorite features on the Pro Models macro photography macro is is one of the seven lenses of the new Pro camera system with a 10x optical zoom range going from 13 to 120 mm focal length making iPhone 15 Pro Max more powerful and more versatile than ever now back to Jaws iPhone 15 Pro will enable great workflows for photographers and filmmakers that previously weren't possible using a USB 3 cable with iPhone 15 Pro enables incredibly fast transfer speeds so it's much faster to transfer your large Pro Raw photos or prores videos to your Mac and now you can use your iPhone with capture 1 to shoot and instantly transfer 48 megap Pro raw directly to a Mac easily creating a Pro Studio suited for today's fast-paced needs iPhone 15 Pro also supports recording prores video directly to an external storage Drive video production can quickly swap drives and keep iPhone as the main camera on set recording to an external drive enables even higher quality recording options pushing prores 4K up to 60 frames per second for the first time a great option for filmmakers to create cinematic slow motion we are also introducing log en coding to make prores even more powerful for our Pro users enabling more range and flexibility for visual effects and color grade in post production with log en coding iPhone 15 Pro will be the first smartphone in the world to support the academy color en coding system or Asus a global standard for color workflows making it easier for filmmakers to use iPhone in their production the iPhone 15 Pro camera system pushes the limits of what you can capture with a smartphone the precious memories you capture on iPhone look incredible when viewing with apple Vision Pro photos and videos look lifelike and panoramas expand to create an immersive experience that wraps around you and there's one more unique feature we've created just for the world of spatial Computing with iPhone 15 Pro you can now capture spatial videos we use the ultrawide and Main cameras together to create a three-dimensional video you can then relive these memories in a magical way on Apple Vision Pro this is really important as as your iPhone is with you all the time so you won't ever Miss capturing a special moment using spatial video like your family's Beach vacation spatial video lets you feel like you're right back to that moment in time you can also share these spatial videos with anyone with an apple Vision Pro so they can feel like they were there too capturing spatial video will be available later this year so this is the iPhone 15 Pro our best and most Pro iPhone ever with a new beautiful strong and lighter titanium design as well as Next Level performance from

       " \"if you zoom out to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max I think it's fair to say that these are a fairly forgettable set of phones there is no one big defining feature that puts them on the map like the dynamic Island was on the iPhone 14 Pros or the 120 hertz Pro motion displays on the iPhone 13 Pros the famous summary page that Apple makes for each of their new products for this phone half of it was filled with features that were already well used to there's not even a bold new color to aesthetically differentiate itself this is the single driest selection in recent memory for me but it's only now that I've started Living with it that I've realized so many little things things that are easy to miss things that Apple didn't even mention that all add up to make this a more surprising more immediately beneficial experience than I would say I've had with any iPhone I've tested before this especially when it comes to cameras in case you're wondering by the way this is what you get when you order a 15 Pro it's fairly standard Apple fare no longer a black box that you used to get with Pros I imagine to use less ink inside you get the phone the new USBC cable and the little insert which has your sim ejector tool manual and a couple of Apple stickers now this cable is a bit of an upgrade with this woven fiber around it which is going to make it more durable and is very very resistant to tangling but just know that it isn't a fast cable the iPhone 15 Pros are capable of USB 3 speeds I.E 20 times faster than lightning used to be but with the default cable you will not get them this is pretty standard for most phones though okay so the first thing about these phones which I guess I didn't realize the full potential of until switching to the pro Max is the action button this brand new programmable button that sits in place of the Ring silent switch that you can set to whatever trigger you want and my heart take when I first saw this was well you can already program things to a triple tap of your power button why bother doing the same thing to a button that's just much harder to reach and the hard to reach part that hasn't changed it still makes no sense to me why a button designed around being a shortcut is so far out of the radius of where your fingers can reach in a normal grip unless you use it for the camera I would say that 80 of photos that I take on my phone I do so in landscape mode and and that works really well with the action button because when you go like this your finger is naturally resting on it the button is designed so that you have to hold for half a second or so to activate I guess to reduce accidental presses and then that activation can take you immediately to not just the camera but exactly the camera mode that you want to be the default and then if you do that the action button will also double as your shutter button when you get there which means this is now the fastest way to be able to quickly record a clip when the opportunity unexpectedly arises it's not perfect because let's say If instead of here the button was actually up here that would mean that you could properly grip the phone without worrying that you're actually covering the thing that's shooting the photos plus you might find that for a lot of commands it's actually much easier to map them to the power button or even the backtab feature which every iPhone has but the point is action button solid new feature has its uses and also something Apple didn't really mention but just kind of showed as part of one of their slides was that the iPhone 15 Pros are coming with a new thread radio which may well make them better at communicating with other Apple Smart Home devices so I have no doubt that people will find cool ways to use this action button to even control the home okay this is a phone let's talk about call Quality we don't talk about call Quality very much mostly because it doesn't tend to change between Generations but there is a really cool new Improvement here to voice isolation so I've got my fiance drisha on the line right now she's using a 15 Pro and it sounds terrible yeah okay so let's try the voice isolation [Music] without any noise it literally feels like you've turned the tap off that's crazy there's a lot and while the voice isolation won't improve the quality of your speech it will pretty much erase all background noise without reducing it and then just like the new FaceTime video effects what's quite cool is that these voice effects because they're happening on a hardware level they persist whatever the software you're using whether it's a normal call a FaceTime call or a zoom call what I would love is to be able to get this working with Voice Notes too because I mean clearly it can and that is like my main form of communication nowadays okay the phone also surprised me when it comes to Performance naturally being the nerd that I am one of the first things I did was Run The geekbench Benchmark the CPU in this new a17 Pro chip is coming out about 10 faster and the graphic score is up by 20 from last year which is solid and in a way a bit surreal because it's actually approaching the graphics performance of the M2 powered MacBooks but then at the same time if we zoom out and look at what's happening in the General market these are not out of the ordinary generational leaps in power but what was genuinely surprising is that after a long time it finally feels that we have something to do with that power what you're seeing right now is Resident Evil Village playing on an iPhone and we've seen plenty of pretty phone games before like Genji impact but what is crazy about this is that this is not Resident Evil Village mobile this is Resident Evil the same Resident Evil that you've seen on consoles all the assets and the textures are taken straight from the PlayStation 4 version of the game and then it's pairing that with some of the tech from the PS5 version of the game like HDR which is a much higher brightness range than last gen consoles could support now as someone who has played this game on current gen consoles holding it in my hand not even on one of those bulky handheld PCS with a battery life of two hours on a smartphone is very impressive it is only running at 720p resolution as opposed to the 900p that the PlayStation 4 runs the game at but still the fact that it is the same game that runs on a box like this or a box like this on your phone that fits in your pocket and also includes the display the surround sound speakers and everything else built in it has definitely felt like one of those feet of Technology moments excuse the the dazzling so many times when I'm away somewhere the only Gadget I have with me is my phone and I just wish that I could have some proper meaty offline single player games that I could sink my teeth into so if this whole console gaming on a phone thing actually catches on now I'm gonna be a very happy guy and you probably won't see many Tech videos but we don't know if it will yet there's only four console games like this currently announced exclusively for the pro iPhone 15s one of them is the latest Assassin's Creed which is very cool and surreal because that game looks like this but one of the games that I spent growing up with on my PlayStation Portable was also Assassin's Creed and that looked like this but it does raise questions like how easy is it to Port over a PlayStation 4 game to an iPhone how many will come after this initial honeymoon period and will they also come to Android phones later on because powerful as this is the graphics performance on the iPhone is not dissimilar to what you get on the latest Samsung we have no idea there is also support for Wi-Fi 6E base into that package which is basically a less congested version of Wi-Fi 6 but does need a router specifically with that technology in mind okay let's talk about the design right now where we are with the iPhone 15 Pros High Point we've just come from a set of phones that were pretty yes but very heavy and not comfy to a set of phones that are just as pretty but more comfortable thanks to the new contoured edges much lighter thanks to the material swap to Titanium not to mention more practical thanks to having a matte finish all the way around with the iPhone 14 pro that I used to use the fingerprinty stainless steel sides the couple of marks I've got near my charging port from where I've well missed and the dust in the mute slider are the only giveaways that this is a well used phone but with these I mean obviously we'll need about three months to say anything conclusively but it feels like the combination of having both matte and brushed side rails should help to hide that it's not the dream though because even though the material does hide scratches better it does look like it can be scratched easier and also fingerprints on these darker phones tend to show up as a light area which means that around your buttons you tend to almost get this haloing effect from past fingerprints that you struggle to wipe away they're not permanent marks they'll come off straight away if you go in there with a cloth but you can't be doing that every day so you will notice it from time to time zooming out a little I still think the most comfortable shape that a phone can be is pebble-like I've asked my whole family and every person agreed that the iPhone 11 Pro is more comfy to hold and use than the 15 Pro but then I suppose that thing has its own set of issues because the curved nature of the phone introduces a bulge around the screen and that's actually something the new phones do especially well the bezels are really really Slim So it's one of those things that of course you will get used to the same way you get used to the acceleration of a new car or the sound quality of a great audio system but then anytime you get a hint of perspective like seeing anyone else's older iPhone it does make you reappreciate what I think is a bit of a design feat okay so I mentioned that cameras are something pretty special on these phones and let's be very clear about something what makes these cameras special is no one thing in isolation it's not about the ultroid camera that lets in a bit more light it's not about the new coating that helps reduce the amount of lens flares on this lens because honestly you still get enough lens flares on the main camera to account for both it's not any of these pieces on their own but it's how the whole thing works together as a system that's even better than the sum of its parts and this is the thing that I've only now realized having used the phones so for starters the iPhone 15 Pros take 24 megapixel photos again that doesn't sound very impressive when you think that the latest Samsung can take up 200 megapixel shot but it's the fact that the iPhone can do this 24 megapixel by default that's the key thing that it takes 24 megapixel in in auto mode with no perceptible compromise that I can see not in terms of the time taken to capture not in terms of the dynamic range of the image not in terms of the amount of post-processing that happens afterwards it's actually faster here to take a 24 megapixel shot than it is for most phones to take a 12 megapixel shot which is the industry standard default even four phones which have 200 megapixel camera sensors so that's one part of it but then you've got the file format most phones when they take photos they output those photos as JPEG images for quite a few years though the iPhone instead uses a file format called Heat which is really similar to JPEG and image quality but with smaller file sizes actually about half the size now that the resolution of the photos has gone up though the image size has gone up with it but even though the resolution has doubled the image size has only gone up one point five times which leaves you with this bizarre situation where the 24 megapixel shots taken here take up less space than the 12 megapixel shots on other phones oh and that smaller file now also includes both the portrait mode data and the live photo data at the same time this is kind of where it really started to click with me because I think like motion photos in general are an amazing feature I was making a little video for drisher and I's anniversary recently and the only way that video was possible was because for every photo I take an obvious the phone was also storing the entire scene just before that shot was captured and so long as you're doing that it is super quick to then save that motion as its own video which you can put into a longer project then I also love portrait mode every single time I'm trying to take a nice photo for someone else I will take like three normal shots and then I'll take a separate set of three portrait shots to let them decide which one they prefer because they're almost two very different propositions the normal shot is very practical and utilitarian and then the portrait shot is very cinematic all of that extra time all of that faff and all about having to think is just gone because you don't need to be in portrait mode to take portraits you just take the photo as you always do and as soon as a person a dog or a cat appears in the image this little F will pop up when that F pops up you know that you are automatically capturing depth information and that you can go back into the shot after you've taken it to tweak the level of portrait mode you want to apply again in 24 megapixels so double the resolution that portrait mode used to be the F will also come up if you ever tap to focus because then the phone knows that you're trying to focus on something in particular which means that even if you miss focus on that subject in the moment you can go back in afterwards and tweak it and so what I'm really getting to here is that Apple has managed to build with the iPhone 15 Pros a camera system for which all you have to think about is just this one thing is it framed the way that I want it to be the rest is done for you as well as now photonic engine this was introduced last year as a level of processing applied to each image to add in extra detail and fix up the colors but when it was announced it wasn't for all camera modes for things like portraits and night mode which already required a lot of processing that wasn't Headroom to also have the photonic engine going on not anymore it now works in portrait mode it works in night mode it works on the front camera and it works on every single magnification of the rear camera and you can really tell the difference like I went out a couple of days ago to get some shots of the night sky and while sometimes between iPhone Generations you do struggle to notice the difference the improvements here are at a glance instantly recognizable and the other thing that they've addressed is HDR HDR in photos is one of Apple's historic long-running weaknesses I think it originates from the fact that Apple doesn't want to over process images but the truth is in a lot of cases like when you have really harsh backlighting behind you you kind of have to well it's better here I wouldn't say that Apple's completely solved all instances of parts of the image being Overexposed but at the same time I didn't expect a difference this noticeable versus last year's phone you can tell on the rear camera and you can also tell on the front camera so do you kind of see what I'm saying about these cameras this idea that no individual aspect is particularly groundbreaking or new it's just the fact that it all comes together in the highest quality lowest hassle way that I've ever seen with by the way the smoothest operating version of the camera app that I've ever seen on a phone or within like a three megabyte file now is how Apple's trying to pitch this thing as seven lenses in your pocket there's some truth to it but you can't really take that statement at face value see the way it works is the iPhone 15 Pros have a 48 megapixel main camera sensor if you tap on this one time zoom it'll cycle between three different focal lengths between 1X and 1.5 x now because the camera is 48 megapixel and you're outputting images in 24 megapixel you can between 1X and 1.5 x Zoom use different amounts of this full sensor to achieve a result that is still genuinely a 24 megapixel shot and so on the bright side when you take let's say a 35 millimeter photo it is more detailed than if you just took a 1x shot and zoomed in till it looked like a 35 millimeter photo but then the downside is that when you do this you're not using the full extent of your sensor and therefore the image quality isn't as high I wouldn't say the degradation is noticeable but it will be there and it's just a bit icky to call this a 7 lens system when really if you're going to do that you could just add a stop at every single possible different magnification and then call it a thousand camera system as a feature it's fine it does the job but unlike the way it's being presented it is not the same as actually having seven lenses right now let's talk about the new zoom camera so for the iPhone 15 Pro Max only the three times optical zoom lens camera has become a five times optical zoom lens camera and this is a bigger upgrade than it initially seems they've not just taken the zoom camera that was already on the pro and stuck a bigger lens on it the pro Max has a larger sensor and better stabilization than the regular Pro too and let's be very clear even though five times Zoom is not the highest magnification we've ever seen on a phone by a long shot this is still a very good quality five-time zoom camera which means that in most lighting conditions the shots look pretty good even at 10x and the lens has so much natural foreground background separation that oftentimes you don't even need to rely on portrait mode for that DSLR like separation and check this this is a one-time Zoom portrait taken on the 15 Pro Max notice how much Distortion there is on my face taking a portrait at 3x is far more flattering because you get to be further away and then 5X fsos slightly even more flattering than a 3X so it has a purpose and it's just a fun tool to have because 5x feels like such a distinct image to what a one x image looks like and you don't have to step back as much as I was expecting to fit the person that you're trying to shoot in the frame but it is still very much a trade see the way the main camera sensor on this phone works you can only get so-called lossless zoom in between 1X and 2x and so the entire gap between your 2X and your 5x Zoom range now that relies on pure digital Zoom which is why in these shots the 3x image while fluttering is definitely the weakest quality and as you get to like 4.9 x like just before the 5x optical zoom camera kicks in it does start to look a bit rough also worth bearing in mind the optical zoom cameras on both the pro and the pro max they're not 24 megapixel they're so 12 as is the ultrawide lens which is pretty normal for a phone but it just feels like one of the only slight remaining inconsistencies but camera comparison versus the Samsung coming very shortly so if you want to see that then he's sub to the channel would be Mega pixel now based on some browsing on X people are worried about battery and rightly so the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max had insane battery for their prospective sizes but then the 14s were not as good and they also seem to degrade faster over time now that could be a few different things it could be the iOS 17 beta that was pretty rough on battery it could be the extra brightness of the screen putting more pressure on the battery and causing more heat on the inside which can permanently degrade your cell whatever it was Apple didn't really acknowledge or address any battery concern so it's not clear if any of those long-term effects will be present but what I can say is that the iPhone 15 Pros are better for sure than the 14 Pros with a bigger battery capacity even more mature software and better heat dissipation which should make that battery last longer over time but as well as a camera test there will also be a very detailed battery test alongside it so there will be a lot to talk about there I am slightly sad to see that the charging speed hasn't gone up which would have been one of the main perks of a USB 3 Port but at least the phone does leverage some of the capability of USBC with the ability to reverse charge your airpods what actually is great news and what I'm really surprised Apple didn't talk about at the event was that it's not just airpods the fact that your iPhone 15s can now deliver power through USBC means that almost anything that you can plug this cable into you can charge which means that for the first time since switching to the iPhone like four years ago I don't have to feel like I'm the battery lead in my friend group I guess the main perk of iPhone being USBC now is some semblance of stability this move was always on the horizon it always felt like it could be just next year when Apple switched over and so now that it has just happened you can safely invest in some USBC accessories that you know won't become outdated for at least a couple of years but probably more I know there's been a lot of rumors about the portless iPhone but honestly I I just think they're a long way off there are so many things that would suffer if Apple made that move anytime soon like being able to listen to proper lossless music being able to transfer massive prores video files which apple is touting as one of the new features that you should use as well as all kinds of really Niche things like using your phone as a screen to Pilot a drone where you need the lowest latency possible in order to bring this all together then we need to consider the prices for the iPhone 15s the pro is staying at its price of 999 and the pro Max is going up by 100 to 11.99 to which I would say I think the normal Pro is in a really good place right now it's an iterator phone but one that ties together a lot of the Loose Ends that Apple has had over the years integrating all the bitty camera features together sanding down the rougher edges of the design and bringing a little lift to the battery while it's at it the pro Max is a bit of a harder pill to swallow since the only additional difference for the extra hundred dollar Gap in price is more storage and your 3x lens becoming a 5x lens which is an upgrade but not a massive one and one that in some situations can leave you with worse shots than the 3x but that does not invalidate it the 15 Pro Max is still the phone for people who want the best iPhone it's the phone that I've already switched to especially because of the battery and also important note the phone isn't actually necessarily more expensive if the quoted prices Apple gives are always us but like here in the UK the 15 Pro Max is the same price as the 14 pro Max and that's the 14 pro Max with half the storage okay we'll see you in the comparisons\",\n",
       " \"the iPhone 15 is just around the corner and it will come with a lot of changes something else that's just around the corner is that big thing that we're announcing very soon the third teaser just came out which you can check out on Instagram and there are five teasers in total so just two more left until everything will be revealed comment down below if you have any idea of what our big announcement is and if you're right you might win a special prize so here are not five not ten not 20 but 21 of the biggest iPhone 15 changes to expect just like how you can expect some great value headphones from our sponsor soundcore the soundcore space ones are a brilliant offering with amazing adaptive ANC a comfortable fit alongside high res audio with ldeck supports check them out by using the link below as well as later in the video so the first thing to expect is a new frame something that hasn't changed at all since the iPhone 12. the frame would still be flat but it would round up towards the top making it far more comfortable to hold in the hand without it necessarily affecting your grip and on the Pro Models this Frame would be made out of titanium rather than stainless steel which will also make it more durable as well as lighter which was one of the main complaints of the Promax model before this titanium frame is also said to be brushed so fingerprints won't be that big of an issue anymore on this new frame we are said to be getting some redesigned volume buttons that are thicker and a bit easier to press and also a brand new action button on the Pro Models only and would replace the mute switch similar to the action button on the Apple watch Ultra you'll be able to assign certain apps to it as well as actions such as the torch the camera screen recording Focus modes silent mode and so on then the dynamic island is said to be coming to the standard iPhone 15 models too something that was previously exclusive to the Pro Models this means that more and more third-party apps would start making use of the dynamic Island we're also going getting some new processors plural as once again the non-pro models would be using last year's Apple a16 chip with a 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max getting the a17 the a17 is rumored to be getting one extra GPU core as well as a pretty major clock speed bump from a 3.46 gigahertz to 3.7 but the main highlights of it would be the switch from 5 nanometers down to three which would not only further improve its performance but also make the Apple 17 chip more power efficient which brings us to the fifth change significant battery life improvements given not just by the switch to 3 nanometers but also by the big increases in battery sizes with the iPhone 15 getting an 18 bump in battery capacity the 15 plus getting a 13 bump 14 for the 15 Pro and 12 for the 15 Pro Max keep in mind that despite the 15 plus having the largest battery the pro Max would still likely last longer thanks to that three nanometer chip and that Dynamic refresh rate display there have also been some rumors that Apple would be bumping the ram to 8 gigabytes from six on the Pro Models however there have also been some contradictory reports here so this isn't quite clear yet I am leaning more towards the 8 gigabyte rumors as L plus had six gigabytes of RAM ever since the iPhone 12 Pro and a RAM management just hasn't been that great on recent iPhone models so more RAM is definitely needed just like more storage is also needed and luckily that's exactly what we're getting with the base models of the Pro Models Now set to start from 256 gigabytes as opposed to 128 and go all the way up to two terabytes whereas before the upper limit was one terabyte but really one of the biggest changes that the iPhone 15 will come with will be the switch from lightning to USB type c finally of course there will be one big caveat here which is that the iPhone 15s will be limited to USB 2.0 speeds but hey at least on the bright side we do get colors colors that would match the color of your iPhone and then apparently these new cables would also be braided so they will be more dribble as well as longer 1.5 meters as opposed to one now if you do have a pro model then the port is said to be faster rumors are pointing towards Thunderbolt 4 speeds of 40 gigabits per second as opposed to 480 megabits per second on the standard 15 models so this means that we'll be able to transfer prores and prora files much faster which has been a major issue in the past however that cable that will come inside the box of the 15 Pros will still have USB 2.0 speed so if you're on Thunderball speeds you'll need to buy a separate cable that Apple apparently will be selling and yeah it won't be cheap speaking of ports and cables your charging speed is also said to be improved from the current Max of 20 watts officially and 27 watts unofficially to about 35 Watts I do have a feeling that this will just be on the Pro Models but we'll have to wait and see and we're also said to be getting faster wireless charging too with apple now supporting the new Q I2 or G2 standard meaning that we will be able to get 15 watts of fast charging no matter what wireless charger we use currently 15 watts is restricted to Max save charging with any other wireless charger being limited to 7.5 Watts at most okay so now let's talk about the cameras right after I show you more on the best value headphones from our sponsor soundcore so as I mentioned earlier the soundcore space ones are an excellent set of headphones rivaling the lines of Sony and Bose but for a fraction of their price their noise canceling is superb with an upgraded ANSI structure for especially strong reduction of mid to high frequencies and this noise cancellation also adapts analyzing external sounds to provide Optimal Performance wherever you find yourself plus their ability to reduce talking is so impressive that when you're playing music outside voices are completely canceled out they're also a great fit with a full seal over the years and they are lighter than the compensation this is likely thanks to their 8th degree floating axis design which helps them fit to any head shape perfectly and most importantly there are 40 millimeter Dynamic drivers offer high-res audio with ldac support for more immersive bluetooth listening so if you have great value headphones definitely check them out by using the link below and now back to the video so the iPhone 15 and the 15 plus are said to be getting the same 48 megapixel sensor that we got with the iPhone 14 pro and Promax last year and that's just awesome this sensor was incredible with lots of depth of fields very good low light performance and just a lot of sharpness overall but if you're thinking that you're gonna get the same camera performance as the iPhone 14 pro you're wrong prores and pro raw will likely be disabled meaning that you won't be able to take 48 megapixel photos but rather everything will be bent to 12 megapixels unless of course you use a third-party app like hellyte on the bright side um that 2x sensor crop option from the promo models will likely be available so for the first time since the Pro Models came out we'll have optical zoom on the non-pro iPhones so what about the Pro Models then well in terms of the 15 Pro it doesn't seem like we would be getting any major camera upgrades there is a new Sony sensor that's rumored a sensor that is quite massive almost one inch in size but that is said to be exclusive to the 15 Pro Max one in sensors are what you would find in compact digital cameras as well as in some other Flagship phones like the xiaomi 13 Ultra the alpha find X6 Pro and more these phones have an incredible depth of field and some outstanding lullaby performance we could see something similar from the 15 Pro Max 2 this year but really the Highlight feature of the camera would be that Periscope Zoo module also exclusive to the 15 Pro Max just like we've seen on phones from Samsung Google xiaomi and many others this new Periscope module would allow us to get much greater Zoom levels above 3x optically apple is rumored to be using either a 5x or a 6X module here which on paper might seem inferior to Samsung's 10x however do you remember that Google for example is also using a 5x module like Apple's rumored but in combination with a high resolution 48 megapixel sensor as opposed to Samsung's 10 megapixel sensor and the results are very close to Samsung's results so at the end of the day the quality of Apple Zoom would purely depend on how high resolution sensor they actually pair with that 5 to 6X optical zoom lens but I would honestly be surprised if Apple's Periscope module doesn't end up at least matching Samsung's considering how late Apple it is so does this mean that the 15 Pro is literally getting no camera change at all well not quite it is said to be getting a new lidar sensor that would be more power efficient and likely offer a larger range of detection too essentially this should help with autofocusing in dark environments at greater distances but yeah if you're looking for some great camera upgrades this year the the 15 Pro Max and not a 15 Pro is the ones you get speaking of the 15 Pro Max Apple has tweaked the four factor and made it shorter and narrower to the point where it feels significantly more comfortable in the hand which was one of the main complaints with the pro Max models before the 15 Pro also gets a bit shorter and a bit narrower and it too feels better in the hands than before thanks to that rounded frame too now the reason why the Pro Models are both narrower is thanks to the bezels which are now considerably thinner in fact the bezels on the Pro Models are said to be the thinnest bezels on any other smartphone right now yeah I'm definitely a big fan of that a couple of more changes uh Wi-Fi 6C is said to be included with up to double the speeds as long as you have a compatible Wi-Fi succeed router there are also a number of new color options expected with the non-pro models getting an orange the blue is said to become a bit more vibrant and the purple and the product red are said to be removed whereas with the Pro Models we are getting a new dark blue color very similar to the iPhone 12 Pro specific blue and also a new gray color that we've never seen on an iPhone before I do quite like this new color however I do think I'm still leaning more towards the new blue or you know the classic space gray and the last big change that's rumored is a higher price for the Pro Models bringing the 15 Pro to 1099 from 9.99 and the 15 Pro Max 12.99 from 11.99 of course you do also get more storage but if you simply just wanted to buy the base model then you would have to pay a hundred dollars more now and possibly even more than that outside the US of course that these 21 changes were simply the biggest there are way more changes than just these we will have some more Apple event related videos before the event of next week and yeah feel free to subscribe for those videos and more updates on um the big thing that we're announcing very very soon I'm Daniel this is our Tech and I'll see you guys in the next one xenobtech signing out [Music] thank you [Music]\",\n",
       " \"it is currently 6 57 a.m I just woke up and it's time to order the iPhone 15 Pro Max it's now 6 59 we got one minute I don't know how this website's gonna handle this pre-order I know sometimes websites kind of freak out when there's millions of people on them trying to pre-order at the same time all right it's seven o'clock let's refresh can we can we order it yet oh not yet it's now 701 and it's still not working see this is what I was kind of worried about with millions of people being on this website at the same time 705 and still nothing 710 bro I'm actually trying to order an iPhone for once maybe uh maybe it's just not meant to be it's now 7 15. wait wait wait wait I got it I got it I got it pre-order iPhone 15 Pro okay we're gonna choose 15 Pro Max black Titanium because I think the matte black looks the best 256 gigs and add to bag all right my order has been placed arriving Friday September 22nd\",\n",
       " \"we have iPhone 15 and all four iPhone 15s have USB Type C and just like last year Apple kept the rule remember the iPhone pro the 14 pro now it's called 15 that is it has the 48 Megapixel dynamic Island camera it's an iPhone  14 pro without the name pro and 15 exact and USB type 100 already on the real pro iPhones the iPhone 15 pro Max and the exact iPhone 15 pro new processor raytracing game super powerful 5x1 optical titanium body and the little button that little button that now doesn't  It's just a button that you press does the same thing as before and it even has extra functions so the more you press the button, tag your friend below because all these iPhone 15s here we'll talk more on Canaltech, this is just a moment  that they came up with USB Type C finally\",\n",
       " \"the iPhone 15 is only a few days away so as it's been the tradition for about 10 years now Welcome to our final leaks and rumors covering everything we know from the lineup to the design to the display the camera all the way down to the price so here's all the info on the iPhone 15 right after our sponsor incognate your information is sold online and it will take years to get every website and every app to delete your data but luckily incognate can do this for you simply set up an account grant them the right to help you and see the progress on their website go to incognito.comtech and get 60 off their annual plan okay so when it comes to this year's lineup just like last year we're expecting four iPhone models two standard models the iPhone 15 and 15 plus and two Pro Models the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max now their standard models are inheriting a lot of the features from last year's Pro Models whereas the pro models of this year these get the new features for 20 23 with the biggest ones being reserved for the 15 Pro Max alone reason why some of the rumors were even pointing towards it being called the iPhone 15 Ultra in terms of the design the standard models are having their frame updated for the first time since the iPhone 12s with a more rounded frame towards the edges that makes them more comfortable to hold in the hand and I could confirm that based on our dummy units both the 15 and the 15 plus feel far better in the hand you don't get that short match feel like you did with the 14s and prior so yeah I do quite like this change the thickness is also increasing to 7.81 millimeters from 7.79 although this isn't really noticeable at all thanks to the rounded Corners also the rounded Corners aren't really making them any less grippy so that's another plus another design change with the standard models are the new colors So based on the leaks we should see a brand new orange as well as a brand new blue with a purple and the red apparently going away now when it comes to the Pro Models that rounded frame is coming too I however this is said to be made out of titanium rather than stainless steel light before which would not only make them lighter but also more durable and there is a good chance that Apple could be using a brushed titanium texture similar to the Apple watch Ultra meaning that fingerprints should not be an issue anymore now with the Pro Models apple is tweaking the dimensions quite a bit so the iPhone 15 Pro is getting shorter and also narrower and I'm just holding it in the hand against the 14 pro the difference is very noticeable the 15 Pro feels more Compact and compared to hold the 15 Pro Max on the top right here is also shorter and narrower than the 14 pro Max by quite a considerable amount I've always complained about how uncomfortable the pro Max was for me because of the wide body and the sharp frame well I'm pleased to say that at least from the dummy units that we have this issue is 100 sold the 15 Pro Max feels significantly more comfortable and it is truly something that I could use on a daily basis and just like the standard models the Pro Models are getting thicker too 8.5 millimeters on the dumb units compared to 7.85 on the 14 Pros so yeah pretty big increase here which will make more sense later in the video another fairly significant design change on the Pro Models is the mute switch which is being replaced by a customizable action button just like on the Apple watch Ultra so we'll be able to assign certs and apps to that button as well as certain functions such as quickly launching the camera app one of my most requested features on an iPhone or setting an alarm or changing between the focus modes and so on I'm also pretty sure that we'll be able to double press it too and maybe even hold it to enable a second or third function as well of course that muting your phone would likely still be possible as one of those options and lastly the Pro Models are getting some new colors too there's a new blue that's rumored to look very similar to the 12 Pro specific blue and also a brand new gray which I two pipe like although I think I'm still gonna go with either the space gray or the blue this year so now what about the display play well the standard models will be getting the dynamic Island from the 14 Pros last year and really the best part about this is that this will push more and more developers to make use of the dynamic Island in fact Google is working on an update for Google Maps to take advantage of the dynamic islands and more developers would follow suit then the bezels are getting significantly thinner on the Pro Models by about half compared to the 14 Pros making them the thinnest bezels on any smartphone out right now and I also predict that Apple would once again improve the brightness levels at least on the standard models as there is currently a very significant brightness difference between the four teens and the 14 Pros so what about the cameras well the standard models are rumored to come with the exact same 48 megapixel sensor that we got with the iPhone 14 Pros last year and that would indeed make sense as Apple has done the same with the iPhone 14s and the 13s they gave them the previous gems Pros cameras now even though the sensor would be the same as on the 14 Pros it doesn't mean that we'll get the same camera quality and features and that's because in the past Apple has restricted prores video and pro Raw photos to just the Pro Models only and I suspect this being the case again this year what this means is that you won't be able to take 48 megapixel Raw photos like you could with the iPhone 14 Pros with all photos being permanently bent to 12 megapixels now you might be able to get around this by using a third-party app like halide but we're not fully sure yet if that would work or not something that could work though would be that 2x sensor crop Zoom that Apple added to the 14 Pros last year giving the non-pro models optical zoom for the very first time on the pro side there are two big changes that are rumored the first is a much larger Sony sensor close to one inch in size that could give us a similar level of camera quality as the xiaomi 13 Ultra the Oppo Find X6 Pro and many more with a superb depth of field incredible low light performance and overall much better camera results than what we could get from the 14 Pros last year however only the 15 Pro Max is set to feature this new sensor so no one really knows if the 15 Pro will see any changes in terms of the camera or not as the second big change is also rumored to be a 15 Pro Max exclusive and that is the new Periscope Zoom module if you've seen our previous videos you probably know what this is It's essentially Apple bringing us high levels of optical zoom above 3x to better compete with Samsung Google Oppo and all the other major manufacturers according to our rumors we should get a 5 to 6X optical zoom lens however the amount of lossless Zoom could be higher depending on the resolution of the sensor that Apple uses if Apple were to use a 48 megapixel sensor combined with that 5x optical zoom lens they could achieve a similar level of Zoom to the Google pixel 7 Pro which was already very close to the current champion the S3 Ultra which features a 10 X optical zoom lens but with a low resolution 10 megapixel sensor aside from this the lighter module is said to be getting upgraded to one that could offer more range and all iPhone 15s are rumored to come with a 7 element lens system for the main module with one Glass lens and six plastic lenses for a Sharper Image in general up until now all lenses were made out of plastic and xiaomi was the only manufacturer who had an actual Glass lens in there moving on to the performance the standard iPhone 50 models are getting upgraded to the a16 chip from the 14 pros of last year while the Pro Models are getting the brand new chip for 2023 the a17 the a17 is a pretty big deal as it is said to be Apple's first chip to be manufactured on a three nanometer process this is coming from the a16's five nanometer process which even though Apple T's S4 it is technically still 5. and what a switch to three nanometer means is that we would get both more performance as well as a lower power consumption than the a16 chip which could improve the battery life which I'll talk about more in just a bit aside from this the clock speeds are also said to be increased from 3.46 gigahertz to 3.7 which is a significant upgrade from one generation to another the ram is also remembered to get bumped to 8 gigabytes from six on the Pro Models however we have had some contradictory reports too so this isn't certain yet although I do hope that Apple does make this change as the RAM management just hasn't been great on the past few iPhones so what about new features well the biggest new feature is really to switch from lightning to USB type c a switch that took only 11 years um to happen and it is only happening because the EU is forcing Apple to do so USBC will be both on the standard and on the pro models with the only exception being that the standard models will be limited to USB 2.0 speeds while the Pro Models are rumored to be getting Thunderball speeds of up to 40 gigabits per second or 83 times faster than USB 2.0 this will of course facilitate all of those prores and infloride transfers which were just a pain in the past but I do believe that we might also get some exclusive features because of this like who knows maybe we will be able to use our iPhones as external storage for our MacBooks that would be awesome yeah we'll have to wait and see but you will need to buy a separate cable for that and apple is rumored to be selling a short Thunderbolt cable specifically for the Pro Models also all cables are now said to be color matched to the color of your iPhone from the leaked images that we've seen it seems like the cables are also braided for extra durability and also longer at 1.5 meters as opposed to one on top of this there are a couple of extra features reubert the Wi-Fi standard is said to be upgraded to iPhone 6E from Wi-Fi 6 with about 2.4 gigabits per second transfer speeds from 1.2 assuming that you also have a Wi-Fi 6C router there's also said to be a new ultroid band chip to help it communicate with the Apple Vision Pro headset better once that releases next year the 5G modem is being upgraded to qualcomm's brand new x70 chip with a better range change lower product consumption and also lower latency and apple is also remembered to be removing the SIM tray in some regions outside of the us too with France the UK the EU and dozens of other countries being potential contenders now when it comes to battery we are said to be getting some pretty major battery size increases here so all batteries are getting bigger by 18 and 13 on the standard models and 14 and 12 on the Pro Models this is why those bodies are thicker to accommodate those larger batteries and I do hope that these larger batteries in combination with a 39 meter chip would give us the best iPhone batteries yet something that I've been struggling with heavily with my 14 pro the charging speeds are also rumored to be increased to potentially 35 Watts up from the current 27 Watts that we're getting on the Pro Models however you will need a more powerful charger than the current 20 watt one that apple is selling so I do expect Apple to introduce a brand new charger if they do indeed include support for 35 watts and wireless charging is also rumored to be improved with the addition of the new G2 standard or qi2 standard which would allow you to get 15 watts wireless charging speeds from third-party Chargers like you wouldn't be restricted to using maxif anymore currently if you're using a third-party charger you are limited to 7.5 Watts maximum and then we have the price the 15 and the 15 plus are set to remain the same at 800 and 900 for the base 128 gig models which is a fairly decent price although I would still recommend someone get a refurbished 14 pro or 14 pro Max instead which you will be able to get for about the same price as these and they would also come with more features such as the 120hz displays with always on that are also brighter the 3x optical zoom lens the better ultrawide the macro and so on the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max on the other hand are set to increase in price by about a hundred dollars or even more than that outside of the US the base model is rumored to get bumped to 256 so so in case you were looking to get the 256 model then the price should be the same as last year and then the highest end model would now be bumped into terabytes uh rather than just one in terms of when you'll be able to buy these uh as you probably know the event is next week on the 12th uh that Friday is usually when the pre-order starts and the following Friday so the 22nd is when they should be shipping I should also mention that the release date for the 15 Pro Max is said to be delayed by about three to four weeks due to production issues which makes sense as this model is indeed the one that gets the most amount of changes all in all I'm pretty excited for the iPhone 15 lineup especially since I'll be switching to the pro Max model this year to get all of those extra camera features but yeah let me know your thoughts what do you think of the entire iPhone 15 lineup and definitely stay tuned for our live stream of the Apple events and you can hang out with us you can talk to us and yeah we'll be watching the event together so stay tuned for that which is on Tuesday the 12th and also stay tuned for that big reveal that we'll have very soon I'm Daniel this has been sitting off Tech and I'll see you guys in the next one signing out cheers [Music] foreign\",\n",
       " \"[Music] okay Apple's iPhone 15s we're looking at all four devices here we have the iPhone 15 the 15 plus the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max uh having spent a few days with these devices there's so much more to talk about than I'd originally thought let's start off here with the 15 and the 15 plus so both of these devices have an aluminum build still they're roughly the same size and shape as the previous generation the biggest difference aesthetically is going to be the rounded edges now if you look at Apple's marketing material they do such a good job selling it right it makes it look like they've created some aluminum pillow for your hand it looks so smooth and soft in the imagery it does look really good apple did a fantastic job making these new iPhones look just distinctly iPhone this is the new rounded Edge design and they have that design language right now no one else is doing it and the same thing goes with the pro devices these have the same rounded edges as the non-pro and they just look so cool I feel like the design language on this is nice especially with that nice titanium color but the moment you case it the design language is kind of lost now in terms of materials the iPhone 15 and 15 plus have that aluminum rail on the side but they also have a new satin finish gloss back and during the presentation they're like this is some color infused glass material and I was like what's so special about that but I realized this isn't just regular glass this is I mean it's a derivative gorilla glass right so colored Gorilla Glass is very uncommon and I thought why would they even do this like what is what was wrong with the previous iteration of the iPhone right so this is the iPhone 14 and it's just a glass back and the way that they color it is they just add a colored layer on the bottom of it and then just the color goes through that see-through glass right why not just run this and I honestly the only thing I can think of like the only thing that thinks like okay maybe this is why it's that if you have colored glass you get to vary the kind of intensity of the color based on the thickness of the glass so on this portion of it where there's like a thin layer of glass it's like a faint pink but then when you have it on the camera hump so it's a thicker layer of glass it's just a more intense color because there's just more of those color particles in it and it's kind of neat but I'm like I don't know it seems it seems a little strange that they focus on this thing but I guess that's what they're going for now the colors are really pale when I started the event I was like those look pretty muted but in person the blue looks like it's like this it almost looks white right almost looks like a very cool looking white color but all the colors this year are almost pastel the pro devices have a titanium Rail and these look really nice to me so they have like a brushed finish to them it's very subtle you kind of have to put it like right up to the camera to see but I think it looks really cool I will say that the fingerprints on the natural color don't show up very readily like it's very good at hiding fingerprints but the black device uh this shows up more ready like this yeah you can see it right here like you can just see the kind of greasy smudges on it also I've noticed that sometimes like the buttons of the area around the buttons it just kind of builds up kind of like smudgy stuff but these are just little details I only bring this up because I feel like because this is the flagship device and the flagship material some people just really care and I thought I'd just share my quick experiences with it but I do think that this like the natural titanium man this is such a nice looking color like everything about this metal just Vibes with me I mean look at me I have a gray set like I love everything gray you my watch is great right when was the last time you saw an all gray phone they're not common the last one I had I think was like the Samsung Galaxy S9 uh okay in terms of its weight so this with its titanium rail is a lighter phone than the previous generation like the iPhone 14 pro now one thing to keep in mind is that even though the weight difference isn't substantial like numerically I think because of the distribution of weight this is it's just a different feeling kind of phone so this is like if you think about the weight distribution on this thing this now has an aluminum plate and because it's got that aluminum plate with the titanium frame I think the weight is distributed more evenly across the whole device on the iPhone 14 pro this didn't have an aluminum plate and there was also a heavier steel frame that wrapped around the perimeter of this device but when compared to the 15 Pro Max this device is just the weight distribution makes this device feel a lot lighter than like you know the eight or nine percent weight reduction that it has it's only single digit in terms of like the absolute number but it definitely feels more I want to use the word agile but what are we talking about like agile phones what I'm trying to make is that this device has it feels a lot lighter than just that that what the numbers would seem to indicate right eight or nine percent doesn't seem that much but it feels a lot lighter and feels good okay I want to move over to the cases so Apple's iPhone cases the ones that are available in the store uh there's like your classic silicone which I'm going to put onto this one just to demonstrate real quick but they also have in their kind of environmental efforts gone rid of the leather cases so this is the fine woven material and it's sitting on top of a pro Max here so the 15 Pro Max but I have concerns about this material actually let's talk about the silicone this feels awesome right I feel like I'm a huge fan of silicone and I don't think that the shape of this case has changed much despite the new rounded edges but this fine woven material this stuff for one it scuffs very easily so I'm just going to demonstrate really quick I'm just take my fingernail don't have super long fingernails right I I mark it uh and it's there and it doesn't go away like this is their pretty much permanently uh and if I did it a bunch of times it would just scuff and unlike leather like leather scratches quite easily as well but that kind of patina is nicely it's got this kind of worn leather look to it it's a look worn like cloth I don't know it doesn't it's not a look to me also this doesn't feel particularly premium I understand it's recycled material but this feels like almost like a cheap polyester kind of like bed sheeting it's strange and it's got that like it's not my favorite material and the fabric is quite thin if you compare this case to like the pixel 5 case this is obviously a dated case quite a few years back but this looked and felt like a very substantial weave case right this is like maybe they had to keep it thin for the magnets like I just I'm just thinking maybe because of magsafe they need the magnets to be a particular strength they got to keep this material really thin so the accessories stick to it I don't know but it just ain't my speed uh there is a clear case a new clear case from dbrand this is called their ghost case so you can see through it and you can see the language the design language and the materials of the new phones which is kind of cool uh I want to talk about the action button so on the iPhone 15 and 15 plus it still has that standard mute switch we've seen this for well over a decade on the iPhone uh and it's just like your standard switch to turn notifications on and off but the new iPhone 15 Pros have an action button and this is a button that's a customizable input and it's the first kind of customizable button we've ever had on an iPhone which is kind of cool but does take some time to get used to because we're so used to just mute switches from literally over a decade of using stuff like that they software control for muting the phone now is a little bit different but in terms of what you can do with the action button there's a whole bunch of things like uh like you can put different Focus modes you have your camera launcher you can launch a flashlight voice memos shortcuts I've personally set it to the camera and for me it's just like any time I've ever had any kind of like winter sports I'm just you can't launch the camera without taking off your gloves and like launching the phone or you have to have like touch sensitive gloves that can like you're like poking your screen to be able to long press a button to launch a camera so much easier it's so Android a lack of a better term but I like it and I think most people will as well just take some time to get used to it now I do wish there was some kind of tactile marking on it so you could feel for it in your pocket to know that this was the thing that you were long pressing to do your action all right let's talk about the display so the iPhone 15 and 15 plus have significantly improved displays compared to the previous generation I think they changed them in ways that just I wouldn't have expected so these now both have bigger screens than the iPhone 14 and 14 plus from last year these have the same screen size and resolution as the Pro Models these have the same brightness the same Peak brightness the same Dynamic Island up top it's got the same HDR capabilities it's really weird how close they are in terms of the overall screen I'm most surprised by the 2000 nits in Peak brightness it's just for legibility when you're Outdoors but that's something that companies usually reserve for like their Flagship stuff but the non-pro models are still missing two features first it doesn't have an always-on display if that matters to you but the second thing is that this is still running a 60hz display on the non-pro amateur model and I really think they use it to distinguish the difference between like the pros and the amateurs because I don't think that the cost of production is that far apart at this point at least not for Apple because the volumes are so high but when I review these phones and you see them side by side the 60 hertz just it's got the stutter right but I really think if I remove myself from this situation I try to like not be a sweaty tech nerd about it I really think like 99 of the world doesn't care about it I've shown it to many of my friends and my family members I was like yeah that's cool that promotion is neat and all but like who cares uh and in that line it's like very very little media takes advantage of that stuff very few games takes advantage of 120 hertz but it's mostly just the UI right when you're in the UI and you're browsing on your phone you're doing stuff having promotion is just so much nicer to look at if your eyes are used to it and the fact that they don't have it is just ridiculous because there are phones out there that are like 300 bucks that have 120hz displays for it to be missing on a 700 phone it hurts and in terms of the bezels on the uh regular iPhone 15 the bezels are a little bit thinner compared to last year these are more aligned with like the 14 pro models from last year but the 15 Pro Models they're very thin the bezels I will say I this is just anecdotal story here when I'm playing games sometimes the meat of my hand would be touching the screen and because the bezels are so thin it would interfere with the button inputs of my fingers it was uncommon but it did happen a few times on the 15 Pro also I think the front glass on all the new devices is actually slightly curved at the edges if you run your finger against it you can feel it so screen protectors might not easily cover that full front screen and in terms of the ports so thanks to the EU we have USBC ports baby we've always wanted this I'm still in disbelief that this is like something I'm staring at USBC ports on an iPhone uh so the regular iPhone has USB 2 speeds uh pro model has USB 3 speeds there's no like malicious intent here I see a lot of the comments are like oh my gosh why does the you know the regular iPhone 15 still have usb2 I think it's just the chip this chip that's in here the the a16 bionic it was never meant to have USB 3 speeds it was just not a thing when that chip was developed and that's the chip that's in here so no USB 3. now if you do frequently dump massive files from your phone onto your laptop and you do need that speed you got to go for that iPhone 15 Pro but you also need a new cable because the one that comes in the box is this thing here so this is a very nice looking braided cable double ended USBC however this is USB 2.0 I see my Twitter light up with people who are very angry about this it's very normal like I can't think of any phone company or a laptop company even that does include a USB 3 cable for charging it's invariably like USB 2.0 that's the industry standard when it comes to charging cables for charging uh okay the other things you can plug up to that hole basically anything with a USB connection you can plug up keyboards and monitors you get like 4K 60 DisplayPort out and you can charge your iPods you can charge the old ones with lightning cable and the new ones with the USBC cable because the new one has a USBC Port now in terms of performance the a17 chip is faster like you would expect and it can sustain a full workload a little bit longer than the previous generations of the iPhone Pros but it's nothing crazy like I don't think at this point people are using their phone to me like man if only this phone was faster right that's just really not a thing I will say that the GPU has seen like the biggest jump this year uh they did showcase some games I was able to test out an early build of Resident Evil Village this looks very good for a phone it's a really demanding game I remember benchmarking this thing on like RTX 3080 laptops even last year and to see it running on a phone with all the original assets at a consistent 30 frames per second is very cool it feels like the GPU capabilities on this phone is similar to like a PS4 like an Xbox one it's it's very impressive considering the size of it but it's like in case people are wondering like is it like a PlayStation 5 it's not but considering the size of the device very impressive now in terms of battery life so I ran the same battery testing that I did three years in a row now and I didn't see much of a change in terms of like the overall battery life of the phone but what I did notice was a big spike up in the gaming battery life so Pokemon unite isn't a very demanding game but it does just suck up juice and I ran this test a couple times it's a lot better this year I think it's just the GPU on the a17 pro a lot more efficient okay I'm gonna wrap up with a conversation about the camera but I'm going to steer this conversation to just how I use the camera like the stuff that I find interesting or important about the camera so all four of the new iPhone 15s this year have a 48 megapixel main sensors both the regular devices and the pro devices the sensor on the pro devices are going to be bigger and better but still 48 megapixels and they also shoot with 24 megapixel files so if you took like the original 12 megapixel file from yesteryear and you added 50 more pickles pickles pixels going up and then 50 more pixels going wide that would be the new shot so it's about 50 bigger in terms of file size I would say on the regular iPhone 15s the shots in 24 megapixels are more detailed slightly but I just don't think worth that exercise uh the extra 50 size is like it fills up your phone faster it's harder to work with you're sending out more data if you're sharing photos it's just it's a lot and I don't feel like the sensor on the regular iPhone 15s really makes good use of that extra resolution but on the pro I would say it is worth it uh they just the detail is there I think it's absolutely worth that larger file size so if it were me my decision if I had either one of the regular phones I would just set it to the 12 megapixel shot and just save that file space and then if I had on the pro I mean the 12 megapixel shots still look better anyways but if you want that extra resolution and you don't mind the larger files it can take advantage of it now in terms of low light photography it's still not great I mean Apple talked a little bit about how they improved it but the pixel 7 devices and Samsung's s23 devices look better to me Apple also talks about how they addressed some of the lens flare that has been in some of their photography so sometimes you'll see some reflective orbs floating around some of your shots uh they're definitely less pronounced on the iPhone 15 cameras but they're still visible here and there and it's particularly noticeable still in night shots with bright lights now in terms of the multiple focal lengths that they have for the main sensor I can shoot like 24 28 and 35 millimeter when I first saw the presentation I was like that's kind of neat but isn't it just like crops like it seems like it was just cropping in on that main sensor it turns out there's a lot more to it so there is a very interesting technical method as to how they do it like so they're capturing light data from multiple lenses and then fusing it together to create the image it's very cool in terms of how it's done but in terms of how I use my camera like I don't feel like I've ever taken a shot and switched I wanted to even you know the difference between a 24 and a 28 millimeter is very small at least for the stuff that I shoot and then even at 35 not that useful for my personal photography okay but the thing that I thought was the coolest thing by far is the automatic portrait mode and I actually think that this is going to be copied by other phone companies it's the ability to just basically take a shot not think about it and the phone will capture the depth data so you can adjust the focus later and to not think about it like to just not have to press portrait mode and just and just does it automatically is super cool so if it detects a face or like a human face or A Pet's face it can supposedly do it I did notice that it only works for like large pets like my kid has a goldfish it didn't work for that but if you have just regular large faces it works and it works really well and just the ability to adjust this stuff in post but not think about it when you take the shot is so useful like it's just a nice looking shot but you do need to keep in mind that that original shot that you take has to be in Focus like if it wasn't in Focus that it won't be able to fix it uh using this portrait mode stuff uh okay last thing the zoom so I'm sure you're aware by now the iPhone Pro Max iPhone 15 Pro Max has a zoom lens and this thing is a 5x optimal actually you can see the difference between so this device here is the regular other 15 Pro and you can see the lens right there and the 15 Pro Max has a much larger aperture for that zoom lens a couple thoughts I don't think that the 5x telephoto is particularly powerful Samsung has 10x opticals that just are twice as powerful I think that it's good that they're back they're more competitive in terms of the Zoom game they've been comically behind for years I would say the pixels 7 Pro their 5x Zoom is arguably better in terms of like sharpness and detail that's able to capture at that 5x but the fact that the iPhone has a 5x Zoom is great now I think the one conversation that might come up is like should you get the pro or the sort of the pro Max or the pro because when you go with the pro Max your Zoom range is like you start at 5x and anything underneath 5x is not an optical zoom it's like cropped sensors and on this device because it has the 3x Zoom like the original older style 3x Zoom you do have that kind of mid-range telephoto covered a little bit better my take on it is that it doesn't matter it really doesn't matter if I mean if you're getting sweaty over this because you're like a professional photographer that's a whole separate question but if you're just someone who wants to buy a phone and you want to take photos like normal human beings with your family and friends and just things that you do in your life don't buy the phone based on its zoom capabilities buy it for everything else that's just my take on it okay pricing the base models start at 800 the pro model started a thousand but I found that chart again where someone on Reddit had graphed out or charted out the percentage of yearly income that it would take for someone to purchase one of these base model iPhone 15s it spread across a lot of different countries but at the top of the list was Myanmar that's the country my grandmother was from and it's just crazy to see how expensive this phone can be for a lot of people in this world I think it's something we should keep in mind when we look at the prices of these iPhones okay there you have it the iPhone 15.

       " \"Apple's using Titanium on their newest iPhone 15 Pro Max titanium is the coolest metal on the planet for many reasons it's bio-compatible used for creating artificial joints repairing human bones not to mention build Interstellar spacecraft and to construct robots that crawl other planets and of course it's on my ring my ring has titanium that I reclaimed from a wheelchair titanium comes in quite a few different flavors grade 1 being the cheapest softest and easiest machine which is what I thought the iPhone was going to be but then Apple slapped a grade 5 on the screen and I got rocked in more ways than one and let me show you why foreign titanium bar stock laying around as people often do this guy costs 170 dollars for example this 6061 aluminum bar of the exact same proportions only cost me 10. aluminum is what smartphones are normally made from and the color difference between the two metals is glorious to behold especially as it's heated the main reason my Jerry rig knife is only 15 bucks is because I'm using an aluminum alloy and not a titanium alloy and keep in mind this solid Rod is only grade 2 titanium I'm too poor to buy a full Rod of grade 5 titanium since a single notepad sized paper thick sliver already cost 106 dollars all by itself if we do some simple math and scale this half millimeter thick piece of metal up to a hypothetical eight and a half millimeter block thick enough to Mill a phone out of we would be looking at almost two thousand dollars worth of grade 5 titanium and that's not even including the complexity of milling and shaping grade 5 and the dollars worth of iPhone Hardware that goes inside so the math just ain't mathon and there's no way Apple suddenly decided to make negative profit on each iPhone sold you might have noticed that titanium reacts in a very unique way as it gets torched oxidizing an extremely predictable and consistent rainbows going from yellow to purple to blue to light blue and back to gray again as it gets really hot you might be thinking to yourself hey Jerry are you even gonna unbox the iPhone and I say yes let's jump in and see what this iPhone is made from and also how well it can handle the uh the heat of everyday life hit that subscribe button if you haven't already and let's get started [Music] [Applause] [Music] inside the brand new iPhone 15 Pro max box we find the phone itself this blue titanium is almost the same shade as the blue titanium that I made looking under the phone this time we find there's no lightning cable instead we have a brand new braided USBC cable I imagine the world will soon follow Apple's lead on this one and we'll start seeing this port everywhere probably the closest thing we'll ever see to world peace and honestly the phone does feel good about the same as any other rectangular phone but the brushed titanium and the etch back glass do feel super cool but the imitation blue shade is just ever so much off from the actual shade of blue titanium that I think it would bother me long term Apple said again that this screen glass is the strongest glass ever on a smartphone they call it ceramic shield and I agree it is a pretty solid slab of glass we know see plastic screen scratch at a level two or three blasts at five or six and Sapphire would be an eight or nine this dual ion exchange ceramic Shield does still scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7 but level 6 does appear to be quite a bit more faint than usual and I do think apple is onto something with this proprietary glass the front selfie camera is tucked into the dynamic Island and is protected by that same slab of glass the earpiece is a razor thin slit between the glass and the frame no speaker grilles to fall out or get dirty making our way over to the titanium sides apples using something called a PVD coating a physical vapor deposition it's a pretty wild method of applying an ultra thin protective layer over the titanium I don't know enough about PVD to talk about it in depth but you know it is scratchable exactly like the anodized aluminum everything except for this 5G antenna slot for some reason this oval is just not scratching I think they should make a whole phone out of whatever this stuff is the power button is scratchable however and not removable along with the top and entire left side it took Apple 14 hours to apply this finish and my Jerry rig knife 14 seconds to unapply the Finish the new action button is scratchable and our USBC Port down near the bottom is an actual USB 3 with 10 gigabit transfer speeds the regular iPhone 15 is just USB 2 and if you don't know what that means you'll be just fine with either the matte back glass which every phone should have does not scratch the Apple logo in the center is the only thing that's smooth one thing that Apple did change up quite a bit this year is with the cameras we still get that gradual gradient built into the tinted glass that rises up to the camera plateau and some of these camera upgrades we won't be able to see until the teardown but Apple says these three lenses that we can see are actually seven got a LOL a bit of that absolute stretch here at the bottom we have a 48 megapixel main camera which apparently has a nano scale coating on the lens to reduce glare the coating luckily does not scratch off or fracture the coolest camera is definitely the middle one a 12 megapixel 5 times Tetra prism telephoto lens that redirects and reflects light four times before hitting a 3D sensor shift OAS stabilizer if there's one reason to take apart the iPhone 15 Pro Max it's to see what in the world that looks like from the inside then up top we have a 12 megapixel ultrawide apparently these two cameras on the edge can work together like two eyeballs to generate spatial video which I don't want to be the guy to beat a dead horse but that was something Android did 12 years ago with the HTC EVO 3D probably before some of you kidlets with iPhones were even born gotta honor your ancestors Apple said during their event that the back glass panel is easily removable to facilitate repairability which is a huge commendable move and then in the same sentence Apple said that the internal structure of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is made from 100 recycled aluminum which immediately tells us two things one it's nice to see that there's more than just the iPhone design that gets recycled every year and two the internal frame is not solid grade 5 titanium only the exterior this explains quite a bit the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a 6.7 inch OLED display with 2 000 nits of outdoor brightness and 120 hertz refresh rate and lasts for about Infinity seconds before having no reaction to my lighter nice work Apple we'll try out my uh big boy lighter in a second it's time to see if the new Blended aluminum titanium grafted hybrid structure compromises the structural Integrity of the iPhone 15 Pro Max yeah I'm gonna be honest I did not see that one coming you've been watching me durability test smartphones for about 11 years now and most phones do not break iPhones especially do not break like ever and that snap was abnormally quick kinda stunned I'm not sure if it's because the grade 5 titanium frame has nearly three times more tensile strength than aluminum or half the elasticity but the glass did not like being pressed or flexed by my thumb that's crazy on the first bin too internally the phone itself is doing fine of course there's no cracking or shattering of the frame but the back glass is definitely obliterated good thing Apple made the glass modular so it only cost 200 bucks to replace instead of 500 but still if I was a person who just purchased a twelve hundred dollar titanium iPhone 15 Pro Max I would be extremely nervous right now anyway I did not plan on that happening but you gotta admit the crack looks pretty cool the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max does not survive my durability test which means it's time for the big boy lighter the PVD coating is already an imitation blue which would make any actual doing the titanium brain very difficult to see but if we sand it down and expose some bearish titanium we might be able to see if Apple's grade 5 reacts the same way as my grade 5. that's some pretty good looking brush titanium still not sure why it takes Apple 14 hours I'm using a map gas torch which I think along with burning my desk is actually lighting some of the titanium dust on fire you can see the Sparks glow white as they sputter away from the phone now the titanium itself could probably handle the heat but the screen and the phone circuitry not so much the torch definitely accomplishes what my lighter could not and if we look super close at the iPhone frame we can see it start to change colors from the heat apple is indeed using real titanium is it grade 5 though I do have ways of finding out I think it's getting kind of hot in here and now everyone knows the whole point of getting a new iPhone is so that everyone knows you have a new iPhone hiding it in a black plastic case would holy and entirely defeat the purpose and wow side note natural titanium is the move for sure however getting a transparent case to show off your phone is dangerous since most clear cases are made of thermoplastic polyurethane which when exposed to ultraviolet radiation undergoes the irreversible process of photooxidation sunlight makes clear cases turn yellow so on the off chance you ever do go outside you won't have a clear case anymore enter my channel sponsor dbrand dbrand has inexplicably found a way to defeat the sun with their never yellowing completely transparent ghost case and they're offering free Replacements if it ever does yellow which is pretty brave of them the best part is the ghost case is also completely compatible with my tear down skin you can keep your own phone from getting absolutely wrecked like mine with the link down in the description now I pride myself on being extremely thorough and I'd be a Miss if we let this golden opportunity to check the back glass the regular iPhone 15 Pro for similar structural deficiencies as its larger counterpart with some very strong bins from the back nothing happens flipping the phone over to the front again nothing happens the normal sized iPhone 15 Pro survives and does not have the same fate as the max I'm curious to see how thin Apple's titanium layer actually is and what grade it is the iPhone 15 Pro Max teardown is going to be quite a bit more destructive than usual thank you for subscribing and thank you for watching I'll see you around\",\n",
       " \"five reasons you should not buy the new iPhone 15. number one they actually got more expensive the new iPhone 15 Pro Max got bumped up an extra hundred dollars this year as if they're not already expensive enough number two all the colors are super underwhelming this year the titanium is kind of a mix of like gray trying to be gold and all of the other colors are borderline just white three all of the differences are super minor barely noticeable at all the only thing we really got was some random button that nobody really asked for reason number four is that the camera is hardly even better and it still takes pretty grainy pictures to me and last but not least reason number five why you absolutely should not buy the iPhone 15 is because they are absolutely impossible to get a hold of because they're all sold out because I already bought all of them\",\n",
       " \"yeah okay I know everyone has been posting their last minute iPhone 15 leak videos but these are the actual last minute leaks and we have some bad news event is in a couple days let's go so on Tuesday Tim Cook and the Gang are going to be taking the pre-recorded stage to officially announce this year's iPhone lineup in this video we have all of the final iPhone details so if you don't want to know any of that go watch not this in order of money-ness iPhone 15 iPhone 15 plus iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max Yes you heard that correctly iPhone 15 Pro Max no Ultra this year that is as close to confirmed as it's gonna be until Tuesday it will be the pro Max Ultra next year maybe that it's not called Ultra news comes from the Scranton Strangler Mark Garman he is also last minute news dumping but at least with gurman's rundown we know that he has like you know an entire professional career that he could ruin if it's wrong not just some anime profiled Twitter account now before we jump all the way into the last minute Mark German leagues for iPhone let's first jump into this report from Trend Micro that goes over the price increase now we've been talking for months about all these phones going up in price turns out that's wrong Trend force a Taiwanese research firm who is typically pretty accurate lays out that we should actually expect the iPhone 15 Pro Max to receive the rumored price increase going up to a very expensive 11.99 starting price the good news is that if they are correct the iPhone 15 Pro will not be seeing a price increase and will start at the normal but still insane 999 dollars overall trend Force predicts a stable pricing landscape for iPhone 15 iPhone 15 plus and iPhone 15 Pro largely mirroring last year's figures yep all of that good he's good that's good news we want that the pro Max however is a different story equipped with an exclusive high cost Periscope lens it's expected to command a premium likely a bump of up to 100 US dollars to reflect its increased production costs should this price adjustment materialize eyes it would Mark the first such move since the era of iPhone 10. okay okay fair enough I am less worried about price now that makes me feel a little bit better at least I feel in my soul and in my heart I can justify the price increase because new camera stuff at least for the pro Max okay now there's a bunch of stuff specs features that we've been talking about coming to the new iPhone lineup all year but these are this is this is it like whatever you heard before just throw it out this is it touching quickly on the poor people models the iPhone 15 and 15 plus the cheap boys are getting the dynamic Island that is awesome so the notch officially gone from iPhone at least until we get the next SE the base models are also getting a pretty impressive camera performance bump to something more in line with last year's 14 pro very cool all of the new iPhone 15 entries Pro or otherwise will be getting USBC over lightning connectors for the first time in ever and even a brand new U2 Ultra y wideband semiconductor this horrible jumble of words allows for better location services on things like find my giving even more accuracy to the whole shebang okay so now the part I'm sure all of you are here for Pro and pro Max first of all the biggest change maybe titanium I am like super excited about this if only just because it's not stainless steel anymore the shiny stainless steel that looks great when you take it out of the box but as soon as you touch it it goes to yeah glad to have titanium even cooler is that with the change to Titanium comes a slightly more rounded profile so it's going to be way more comfy in your hands and a weight savings thanks to the metal being lighter than steel to a tune of about 10 according to you know who in the same breath Mark also confirms that the bezels on iPhone 15 pro and pro Max will be shrinking by about one third yet another long-term rumor checked off the list by our friend Mark German just like his next victim and just like every year the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max will be getting totally new faster chips while the base models get chips from last year which is that's fine these things are so fast who cares it's like the middle child getting the hand-me-downs from the older brother you know just sucks to suck sometimes now let's talk colors we all love some colors uh sorry to all of the colorblind audience I'm sorry that your life is sad iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 plus will be getting the fun colors per usual it will be coming in pink black white blue and yellow all of the not fun Strictly Business colors are coming to the Pro Models so black white dark blue and this brand new titanium gray like color oh and uh that's a little tidbit Mark tells us that Apple will be discontinuing the leather iPhone cases which is a rumor that we've been seeing for the last couple weeks from other sources this would be of course in favor of a more environmentally friendly material and you know that's all great except the environment I like leather why you do this okay things are about to get really meaty some final iPhone details that are not so great to hear but oh boy we got him jumping back into some news from Trend forces reports this one is full of depresso so uh let me go ahead and get you a fresh cup here go you're welcome alongside Trend forces report of the iPhone 15 Pro Max getting a price increase uh going to 11.99 now we've also learned that despite that price increase the pro Max will still be starting at a measly 128 gigabytes of storage what though why like actually why dim what huh Trend Force even gave us a handy dandy graph that we can use to see just how badly Tim Cook is going to be kicking our peonies into the mud just take a look as far as changes across the board at least starting from the actually interesting devices the iPhone 15 Pro Line we can see some semblance of good news and that is the ram has gone up from six gigabytes to eight gigabytes yay okay a small win for us consumer people whoo and then there it is the right there can you see it no sir no Madam that isn't a little smudge of poop on your screen this is the starting storage size on both the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max 128 gigabytes that is just offensive okay that's terrible that's awful of you to do Tim there are games on the App Store that you can download right now that will wipe out half of that storage instantaneously if I even think about recording a prores video all my storage is gone what you can't do this you can't keep getting away with this how is it that we can catch this guy but this guy keeps getting away with it and not even with the big one you're not even increasing the storage for the big one at least the only people that buy the big ones the pro Max devices are people that have to compensate for having small peonies like Sam Cole oh and that Periscope lens that is brand new to iPhone right big deal this year it's gonna Zoom real far like uh yep apparently that's only a six times Zoom not 10 times or like anything impressive six times Zoom so hello out to that just let just let me die other than all of those last minute leaks which are actually kind of a lot uh you know same old iPhone same iPhone different year but iPhones are only a portion of Tuesday's event like a yearly tradition we are getting new Apple watches one being the series nine and two being the second generation Apple watch Ultra yeah [Applause] yeah yeah yeah so new Apple watches across the board but no design changes at all this year's refresh is a focus on performance and usability with the same U2 chips that are going in the iPhone they're going in the watches for better find my usage and some new colors probably we're expecting a new pink color for the Apple Watch series 9 but also Garmin directly names the ultra is coming in a new black color that honestly just makes me so happy for everybody else I personally for Apple watch Ultra I love the natural titanium color but if you want black at least that's an option now well it's going to be after Tuesday lastly but not leastly German agrees that we are getting new airpods ah but these new airpods are not receiving anything new other than the USB C Port however Mark does say we could expect some new software features via updates at some point stuff like like better automatic device switching and something called conversation awareness which could automatically silence media when the airpods detect people speaking to the wearer sorry I'm laughing because I I don't I don't want that one of my favorite things about airpods ever is I wear them and someone talks to me and I just nod like I can hear them but I actually just hear Taylor Swift that's a feature and that is kinda it you are officially caught up this is our final video before the event so the next time we see you you will have seen these as for me I am going to just crawl into a tree and wait uh wait either for the event to happen or a flock of birds to come take me away whichever one happens first\",\n",

       " \"thousands of Engineers have spent the last year of their lives working on the iPhone 15 and 15 plus what have they changed from the 14. that is genuinely what it looks like on the face of it but I have to say pick the phones up and use them and you realize this is such a jump that no one should ever buy an iPhone 14 from this point on although there's also a few weird slightly sus things going on that we need to talk about okay so I know I joke about these phones looking like basically the same thing as the iPhone 14s but honestly apart from the colors which are very washed out this time around I think the iPhone 15 is an upgrade from every single angle the Frosted back feels way more luxury and now I'd say suits the prices being charged for these phones it's called to the touch the Finish almost feels satin like Smooth matte sides it actually feels very Pro whilst having the convenience of being highly resistant to fingerprints you can't see them even if you try that's partly because of these washed out colors the front and the back now also have rounded edges very subtle to look at but if you ever get the chance to go into an actual Apple Store and hold one of these versus last year's iPhone you also can't not notice how much better it feels I've recently come from the iPhone 14 pro Max and using this iPhone 15 plus it's the same screen size but just noticeably Slimmer a massive amount lighter more rounded softer to the touch I didn't expect how much I'd like it it's kind of felt like when Sony releases a slim version of their PlayStations a few years after the originals and and you look back at the original after that's out thinking if you could come in this size what on Earth were they doing in this size and what I was maybe most surprised to see is that this whole time I've been using the case from my iPhone 14 on my iPhone 15. every button and cutout has worked 100 as intended so worth a try but that might not be the case for every iPhone 14 case aside from the feel the notch has been replaced by Dynamic Island which I think looks better and has some functional perks too like being able to see your ongoing egg timer while looking up the recipe for eggs and then at the bottom you've got the new USBC Port also color matched to your phone and I would say so long as you don't already have like a suite of gadgets made for the old lightning Port it is a good thing it won't be very long until every Gadget is USBC powered and so being on the same standard as them just means you can carry one cable around for everything and also that you can use the iPhone 15s to charge other small gadgets like my PS5 controller was running out the other day and so the ability to just stick it into my phone and not have to plug it into the PS5 itself and sit 20 centimeters away from my screen it felt nice to be a part of the wider ecosystem and it also means you can do fun stuff like plug it straight into most good modern monitors get a latency free 60 frame per second connection load up a game on it connect to PS5 controller via Bluetooth and play this is not a new feature to smartphones as a whole but it is new to the iPhone right let's talk about these screens the iPhone 15 has a 6.1 inch screen and by 2023 standards feels pretty compact the iPhone 15 plus has a 6.7 inch screen which sounds like a small difference but in terms of screen area is a just over 20 bigger and by well I mean anyone's standards really it's a big one I've seen a lot of discourse around the fact that these are 60hz displays and not Ultra fluid 120hz displays meaning that unlike most high-end phones today whose screen refreshes 120 times per second which makes them appear buttery smooth the screens here refresh only 60 which would have been the industry standard but just from like 2015. I've seen a lot of people like 799 phone in 2023 without a 120 hertz display it's an outrage it's a con it's a joke and then the other side that's like well actually the average consumer doesn't know and doesn't care why would Apple bother and the way I see it they're both right in a way the iPhone 15 and 15 plus should have a 90 Hertz or 120 hertz High refresh rate screen they're the most expensive current smartphones that don't have one and yeah I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say it was a little jarring for me at the start feeling all the way around this phone thinking damn the base iPhone actually feels like a flagship this time oh wait oh never mind coming from what I'm used to for the first couple of days it felt laggy especially when changing between the different camera lenses but then also the fact that these phones don't have 120hz displays it doesn't immediately make them some sort of scam like Twitter might make it seem like I handed drisha my fiance one phone with 120 hertz and one phone with 60 hertz and she could only tell which was which when I told her and my parents can't tell the difference even when I tell them and if you don't notice it you're missing out on zero functionality of your phone by not having it so I also wouldn't be doing my job if I said to these people don't buy this phone because it is a 60hz display now there is one caveat to this and that's standby mode if you stick an iPhone on charge and flip it horizontally it'll open this brand new screen saver type interface that I'm actually really starting to rate but because these iPhone 15 screens are locked at 60 hertz as opposed to the pros they can scale up to 120 hertz but also down to one Hertz I guess Apple decided that these non-pro phones would drain too much energy by staying on so the main perk of this whole standby feature kind of disappears but broadly speaking for this whole display debate I would say this if the concept of 120 hertz is something that you're very aware of then you'll probably also notice the difference and if that's something that you know you want there are plenty of great androids at this price like the Galaxy s23 or the Google pixel and then if you really want an iPhone you can just try and find last year's 14 pro for around the same price as the 15 and then if 60 hertz is something you're already used to and you're completely happy with Slash you're thinking what on Earth is this guy going on about then you'll probably actually be quite impressed with the screens this time they're extremely sharp and very bright you might not notice it in most normal environments but so long as you have auto brightness on the next time you're in harsh Sun you absolutely will plus I've already had two quite scary collisions with these phones with some damage to the body but zero to the screens themselves they're very crack resistant the way I think about the durability of recent iPhones is they're not particularly hard to damage but they are very hard to break every iPhone that I've used for a year or so they all end up with scratches in pretty much all areas apart from the camera lenses which in my experience are pretty well protected by the outer rims and the sapphire eating but I've never broken one at least not accidentally charging is on the slower end for 2023. it takes about an hour and a half to fully recharge the 15. two hours on the plus and that's using my macbook's power brick so you're still on one of these bad boys it's gonna be even longer I've noticed it but it hasn't really been a problem for me so far I think ultra high speed charging is cool but the main reason that I'm not upset it's absent here is that you probably won't need it the iPhone 15 has better battery life than any base iPhone I've ever used before not by a landslide you're not getting Pro Max battery here but it is better than the normal sized 15 Pro which I do find quite amusing and you will get six to seven hours of screen on time in a day easy which is on par with the expectation for an Enthusiast phone which I know this isn't but it's priced like one so it should be judged by the same standard and then the 15 plus better than any phone I've ever used on a day-to-day basis before big numbers like the kind of numbers that when I did my battery test which I'll link from this video and it slaughtered my 15 Pro Max made me want to say forget that triple cameras forget titanium and how much do I really need the latest chip because I want this battery just like I want to butter Apple in the subscriber race so if you want to help us to get there then a sub to the channel would be that's a really good yeah okay we need to talk about the cameras I feel like cameras on iPhones and what you're actually getting on each model is nowhere near as clear as it used to be because in a way with these phones what you're getting is less than what you might expect but in a way it's a lot lot more so one of the headline features of the iPhone 15 is a new 48 megapixel camera sensor and so I imagine what most people will do is look at that and then look at the pro iPhones which also have a 48 megapixel camera sensor and think they're the same thing that's actually what I initially assume too but we would be wrong the 48 megapixel sensor on the iPhone 15 is a decent amount smaller than the one on the 15 pros and actually the 14 Pros which in theory should be a pretty major con but I kid you not in practice the software improvements are so massive that I would genuinely rather use an iPhone 15 or 15 plus to capture my entire photos and videos from now on than last year's Pro Max just to be clear yes I'm saying that I think the iPhone 15's camera is better than last year's Pro phones that's not a claim I make lightly the one thing that you lose is zoom the pro iPhones have always had a proper telephoto camera which lets you do this the base iPhones have always had no telephoto camera so you can only do this but because you've now got four times the number of pixels as the last iPhone on the main camera at 48 megapixels you can actually zoom in two times into that to cut out half the image on the top and the bottom and half the image on the sides and still end up with a 12 megapixel area in the middle which is the same res that all of the iPhone 14s shot at just using their normal one-time Zoom mode now it's not exactly the same thing as having a proper zoom camera but the results are better than you might think for a phone that doesn't have a zoom camera but then these new phones start to pull ahead in a very serious way for starters they take 24 megapixel photos even though the 14 Pros also had a 48 megapixel sensor the default photos that you get in auto mode are scaled down to a 12 megapixel shot but the 15s take photos in two times that resolution it's a massive win in daylight conditions like this absolutely pastes my 14 pro Max in detail when the sun's out and you'd kind of expect that Gap to fall the more that the light falls right as then it becomes less about the amount of pixels you have more about how much of the limited light you can let in which this should let more in of except that thanks to the new phones having an extra layer of image processing called photonic engine happening with night mode photos the Gap in a way actually becomes bigger I almost could not believe what I was seeing when I took these samples and then the final key new software perk that this generations of iPhones get is depth information when you take a photo of a person or a pet the phones use both of their cameras at the same time to figure out how far away things are and they store that data as part of the photo file which means anytime you fancy you can come back you can hit edit on one of them add the portrait mode effect and also refocus them all of this is really cool but it just does raise one question which is that why is all of this stuff the 24 megapixel capture the extra processing in night mode the ability to capture depth information and refocus afterwards why is it not also available on last year's 14 Pros the usual answer with most phones is that well it's a next-gen product Within next-gen chipset and all the features require that next-gen chipset and its intelligence to work but the iPhone 15s have the same chip as the 14 pros and in fact the 14 Pros have better camera hardware and also they have a lidar sensor which is specifically built to capture depth information since these are almost all software features that presumably could be ported over it just feels strange that at least at the time of filming nothing has been said about that older iPhones will be able to refocus shots if taken on portrait mode but they won't be able to capture the depth of information without being on portrait mode like the 15's cap but overall I am really happy with the cameras on the iPhone 15s in some ways that you'll actively notice like how it copes with challenging lighting and in other ways that you might not but it's a nice reassurance to have like just knowing that your memories are there in very high resolution should you ever want to print them out or make a slideshow or crop in to post somewhere that you can refocus them to make them just right and that the live photo information is captured by default so you also get that little snippet of video and sound one of the other things that now separates base iPhone turns from their Pro counterparts is the performance the way Apple tends to do things now with their Pro phones you'll get the very latest Cutting Edge chip with the base phones you get last year's chip and I have a feeling that this Gap will only widen over time because historically Apple's chips have been pretty simple you have the A14 the A50 and the a16 but this year apple called the chip on the 15 Pros the a17 pro which makes me very strongly suspect that next year the base phones won't get the same chip they're not going to give the non-pro phones a chip that has Pro in the name right so I'm gonna guess the iPhone 16s will get a trimmed down version of it just called the a17 point being I think that the growth in power on the base iPhones is going to Peter out over the next few years because in the same way that Apple sees 120hz displays as optional for the mainstream well what does the average user need more power for however this jump that we've just had from the a15 and the iPhone 14s to the a60 and the iPhone 15s is a pretty big one you can expect these phones to be about 20 faster than the 14. alongside all the other perks of having a more recent chip they're slightly less powerful than what you would get in similarly priced current Androids but in use it never feels like you've got the short end of the stick I mean basically anything that I've wanted to play on this I played on this no problem the only thing that you will miss out on is the console games that Apple's specifically getting made for the 15 Pros so with all of this in mind are the iPhone 15s worth it well to make a judgment on value we need to factor in the prices they're unchanged from last year if you're in the US but if you're in the UK both the iPhone 15 and the 15 plus are 50 pounds cheaper than the iPhone 14s were at launch which makes it feel like they are back in line and yeah with it in fact the iPhone 15s make the iPhone 14 look like genuinely terrible value for money right now because Apple does still sell the iPhone 14 for 6.99 compared to the 799 for the 15 but for that extra 100 you get a phone that looks better feels a lot better it's faster takes significantly better photos and lasts longer I wouldn't rush to buy it if you're already on a 14 but if you've been holding out for the next iPhone you have my blessing this is one of the best times to upgrade right just before you head off I want to show you something very cool for these phones so this is Taurus and they've got three tiers of phone case each one cooler than the last so the base is the u-pro o sound which is a super protective case it has Maxi built in but also that magsafe ring can flip out and become a kickstand a kickstand that when it's folded away you don't even realize is there but then you can step that up with the U pro o stand R which has the same magnetic kickstand but also adds in the element of full 360 rotation so you can angle the kickstand whichever way you want to bear in mind these cases are also super customizable too like they all come with a free set of replaceable buttons including dark green and orange colors and then this is me and my cat Milo got carried away but then what I think is the craziest case this is the O stand SS and it has built-in airbags no really this entire outer layer is a vacuum sealed air chamber which cushions phone drops by 92 versus not having one and what's also really cool is the insta-fit installation for their Diamond Shield screen protectors it's very quick there's no bubbles or dust on your screen you just slap your iPhone 15 into the frame and the mechanism will do the rest and if you use our link and code in the description this is pretty cool we actually managed to get a full 20 off their normal prices\",\n",

       " \"hey guys Anton Tech Chap and I'm filming this entire review on the new iPhone 15 pro and pro Max so let me know what you make of it does it look like it's been shot on iPhone and actually if I show you what I'm looking at you can see this is my producer James with the 15 Pro recording his new 4k 60 prores onto an SSD plugged into the USB port so for me actually the new USB C Port is incredibly helpful because I can transfer files off we're talking like 10 gigs per minute at 4k60 Pro is plug it in your laptop and Away you go but as well as being able to shoot 4K 60 prores for the first time on new iPhone 15 Pros you can also Now record in HDR and log now I still don't think an iPhone is going to replace your fancy mirrorless or DSLR camera but you know often the best camera is the one you have in your pocket it's a good tool to have although I would be it's kind of surprised if my I don't know professional wedding videographer turned up to my wedding shooting on an iPhone but with the new options you have with the higher quality video and photos which we'll come back to in a second oh I just got bright it's a pretty big step up anyway enough about prores the headline upgrade with the new 15 series is the switch to USBC the ubiquity the universality of USBC how every MacBook iPad well except the cheapest 9th gen model every Windows laptop Android phone and every charging port in new cars they're all type c and while you could faff around with adapters or just rely on wireless charging and airdrop going forward it means if you run out of battery on your iPhone 15 and your friends or Android then you can use the same charging cable and vice versa now I had hoped the switch to USBC may have meant we'd also get faster charging but alas no still tops out 20 watts with Apple's charger which of course doesn't come bundled in the Box although you do get the nice CTC braided cable now and also the regular 15s not the pros actually have a USB 2.0 spec rather than 3.0 so the same speed as the old lining connector so it feels like a little half-hearted sort of switch to USBC although there are other benefits obviously we've got this transfer of footage that I'm recording prores on right now also you can now output to a TV or monitor at 4 4K 60 HDR previously topped out at 1080p 30 although I'm not sure if Apple made this switch out of the pure goodness of their heart so everything could be Universal and lovely I think it had something to do with the EU regulations coming in next year which kind of forced them to switch to USBC if they wanted to keep selling these phones in Europe but regardless of why they did it it is certainly a nice upgrade it will take a minute for Apple's accessories to catch up only the airpods Pro 2 have been refreshed with a USBC case all other airpods the Max's Apple's power bank and obviously still their Mac peripherals only updating but I suspect that'll happen pretty quickly and I'm also excited by all the new third-party accessories and charges coming out that will work with well everything but there's a lot more here than just USBC and some fancy video options although I'll come back to the camera in just a second let's talk about this design and while on the face of it not a whole lot has changed in the last well four years I guess since the iPhone 11 Pro with the most obvious refresh being last year's Dynamic Island which I'm pleased to see has made its way to the regular iPhone 7 scenes now and it is a genuinely useful little notification bar especially as more apps have now been optimized to use it I'll tell you what though the first thing you notice how much lighter this is the 15 Pros have a new titanium band Around The Edge and together with an aluminum frame inside actually reduces The Weight by 19 grams 240 221 and particularly with the pro Max which is a pretty chunky phone it is a very welcome upgrade they've also slimmed down the bezels and it means they've been able to reduce the overall size of the phone it's almost a millimeter narrower and shorter although it is about half a millimeter thicker but they've maintained the same 6.1 and 6.7 inch screen sizes Apple have also slightly contoured just the corners of the frame here on the back so it's a little bit smoother and sits in your hand a bit more comfortably although it is quite subtle and as someone who used the 14 pro Max as their main phone for most of last year these changes do add up to make it just a little bit more comfortable to use we also get a couple of new colors this is the natural titanium which for my money I think is the best new flavor it's kind of of Stony grayish color we also get a dark blue a black and a white although more importantly they've actually redesigned the Intel frame and layout of the 15 Pros so the back glass can now be repaired much more easily and crucially much more cheaply than before I've also just realized this is going to be my 1 000th video on YouTube we're at 999 this is my next video holy moly a thousand videos if you haven't already subscribed I feel like now is a pretty good time let's see what happens over the next thousand videos I'm gonna be so old anyway back to the iPhone and let's talk about this action button it is still a mute switch by default you just long press it to change between loud and silent and the dynamic Island will also react to the change and if you are muted you'll also be able to see the icon at the top left of the screen but now you can customize it to do pretty much anything torch voice recording launch an app although I reckon for most of us myself included you'll just make it the shortcut for the camera and then it also acts as a shutter button yes the volume down does also work as a shutter but you can do anything with it really and I also appreciate that you can use this to toggle on or off a lot of accessibility settings I think for some people this will be a really big deal don't get too close to me when I'm cooking babe I'm playing a preview of Resident Evil Village using what I'm told are PS4 assets natively on the 15 Pro Max albeit at 720p and 30fps and well low to medium settings but still for our phone this is incredible and for now at least it's only possible with the new Apple a17 Pro chip that powers the new 15 pro and pro Max which also happens to be the first three nanometer architecture chip we've had on a mobile we're also going to have the likes of Resident Evil 4 remake death stranding the division Resurgence and even next year Assassin's Creed Mirage which is the first time a full console version of an Assassin's game will be on mobile definitely recommend a controller though this is the backbone one for Playstation Android although they do now sell an iOS USBC version for the iPhone 15 highly recommend because playing Resident Evil village with the virtual touchscreen controls isn't ideal so it's all pretty exciting because yes we have the usual 10 bump in processor performance we actually get double the neural engine performance but these these are kind of just abstract upgrades that we see year on year and really make a noticeable difference but the reason the a17 pro is called the pro is because of this completely redesigned Graphics chip the GPU which is not only a lot more powerful but supports features like Hardware Ray tracing which isn't new you're right the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the flagship Dimension 9200 I believe is from mediatek they both support Hardware Ray tracing actually we're going to have new versions of both those chips like next month so they will compete with the a17 pro hopefully it means more developers will actually make use of it in their games now as strong as these new titanium frame phones are they can still break they can still fall out your pocket off tables so I've teamed up with the lovely folks over at caseify who have sent me a whole range of new cases to protect my iPhones so case if I have refreshed their lineup for the new iPhone 15 and 15 pros and I've got three of the most popular models here I've got the impact the bounce and their brand new ultrabounce each tougher than the last and in case you're wondering uh yeah my real name is Tom and not the tech Jab and what I really do like about caseify is how they combine the creativity and the personality of their cases I mean there are literally so many options to choose from and you can customize your own with proper tough protection in fact all case defy protective cases are aligned with their Eco shock material which increases protection and also makes them able to absorb more of the shock if you happen to be a little bit clumsy and knock your phone off your desk over and over and over again and actually the impact case meets the 4X military grade we get 5x on the ultra impact six on the bounce and a whopping 10x on the ultra bounce which is the strongest case they have ever created and it also has a built-in lens protector for the camera you can literally drop this thing from over 30 feet and maybe I will but I'll save that for my next video just make sure you pair a case to find case with a screen protector though because even if your phone survives a fall you don't want that screen to be scratched so they're tough they look good and case if I are making their products even more sustainable and environmentally friendly than ever so before you're showing your iPhone arrives click my link in the description below to get 15 off your next order at caseify Now versus last year's 14 Pros the new 15 Pro and Promax get an extra two gigs of RAM so we're now up to eight gigabytes and of course we have that new a17 Pro chip replacing the a16 bionic and in this 3dmark Wildlife extreme test we're looking at around a 25 optic in performance although in this new solar Bay Benchmark which includes Ray tracing it's 44 faster however if we switch back but run the 20 minute stress test the stability is lower the new chip throttles more although it's still eight percent faster even at its lowest score but you can also see the 15 Pro Max lost 5 of its battery versus just two percent on the 14 pro Max during this test although we'll talk more about battery in just a second but actually even versus last year's 14 pro Max which is to say I've been using pretty much every day this does feel noticeably nippier more responsive apps seem to load Just a Touch quicker and also I haven't had any of those sort of random slowdowns or stuff says that did occasionally crop up on my 14 pro it's also a big deal because the 15 Pros are the only phones for now at least that will run these upcoming console level games this does now support Wi-Fi 6E although you will of course need a compatible 6E router to make best use of it but overall I would say it's a solid step up and with the new graphics chip along with USBC it makes this one of the most future-proof iPhones we've had in years okay before we dive into the camera which I know you're waiting to see I just want to mention the battery life because we didn't see the much rumored increase in battery size but for the first time the 15 support the G2 standard so if you have a new G2 wireless charger or power bank that can now match the magsay's 15 watts double the previous 7.5 which is a nice little upgrade and actually even though Apple claim the new 15 series will have the same battery as the 14 series that's not been quite my experience so far after an hour of YouTube an hour of tick tock half an hour of gaming and 15 minutes of shooting 4k60 both the 15 pro and pro Max were three percentage points lower than the 14 pro and pro Max all phones with 100 battery capacity and actually bought these two 14 Pros last week so they're all brand new like the 15s although more importantly what I'm very keen to see is how the battery health fares over time because my iPhone 14 pro Max which I've been using for a year is down to 88 of its battery health now to be fair other Brands don't really share that information so there's not a lot to compare it to but I do know versus previous iPhones I've used for a long time that degradation in battery capacity is a lot faster it's more significant so I'm hoping there's improvements with this obviously it'll take a while to figure that out trying to get a photo no more I'm out if I bring up the camera specs for both you can see the main Hardware change this year is that the optical zoom with the pro Max is getting a new five times telephoto whereas the pro is sticking with three times aside from that the hardware is pretty similar same sensors and same resolutions as last year's 14 Pros however there is more to the story with some pretty big software and processing improvements for example the iPhone 15 Pros now combine your usual four into one pixel bins 12 megapixel photo with a full fat 48 megapixel photo giving us a more detailed 24 megapixel shot and also despite having double the megapixels the file size of each photo is only about 50 bigger Apple have also introduced three different focal length options for the main camera so you've got the default one times which is 24 millimeters tap once for 28 and tap again for 35 equivalent to a 1 1.2 and 1.5 times optical zoom using some clever cropping of that 48 megapixel sensor this is definitely aimed at more Enthusiast photographers who have a particular focal length in mind although it's a shame these new focal length options don't transfer over to video but I reckon one of the most exciting new features is how even in the regular photo mode if the camera detects a face a cat or a dog or even if you just simply tap on a subject it will now capture a depth map so you can actually turn this regular photo into a portrait where you can then adjust the bokeh level and also the focal point so if you see this little f-stop icon pop up then you know it's capturing the portrait info and you can tap it if you want to preview that bokeh and then if you press edit on the photo there is this new portrait button that turns it into a portrait with that tasty background blur so the idea is you don't have to worry about whether I should take a regular photo or a portrait which previously had higher shutter lag and missed out on Smart HDR because now with these next Generation portraits as Apple calls it portraits now use the same photonic engine pipeline so their fancy background processing as a regular photo so there's no compromise in quality or shutter lag and for me this is one of the most significant camera upgrades this year night mode shots as well as the new portraits also benefit from Apple's fancy photonic engine and deep Fusion processing now and according to Apple we're looking at up to two times better low light quality and the latest smart hdr5 processing should improve dynamic range color and detail across all cameras and modes up front we have the same 12 megapixel true depth selfie camera as before but this also gets next-gen portraits so again your regular selfies can now be turned into portraits after the fact plus we get all the benefits of that new smart hdr5 as for video the main difference now is that you can shoot that prores at 4k60 we have new log and HDR options and the video quality particularly low light should be improved now usually the selfie camera gets forgotten uh in many phones but not so much with the iPhone and also not so much with video and actually this can also shoot a 4k60 also known prores with login HDR yes it's lower megapixel than a rear camera but it has pretty much all the same features as well as small HDR and the next gen portraits for photos so all that sounds great but is the camera quality really that much better than last year well let me show you a few side by sides and also make sure you have subscribed as I have a full camera comparison with the Galaxy s23 Ultra in the works but my takeaway is that there isn't a huge amount in it I think the most obvious change is how the 15 Pros lean towards a warmer white balance which I would say is a little bit more accurate some shots are also noticeably less over sharpened some photos on the 14s look like someone's just turned the clarity slider up in Lightroom too far now photos look more natural and actually if we crop in so just literally pinch in on that one time shot you can see there is more detail and that's thanks to the new 48 plus 12 megapixel combined shot although on the face of it you may be hard-pressed and noticed now to answer the question of is the 15 Pro Max's Zoom better than the pros well it comes down to what you want really so between 1 and 2.9 times Zoom they're basically the same between 3 and 4.9 the pro wins but then 5 to 25 times the Promax wins makes sense given the hardware and of course in an Ideal World we'd see the pro Max with four lenses like the s23 ultra so there isn't a compromise but the question is do you prefer a three times portrait or a five times portrait 84 millimeters or 120. you can obviously shoot both on both phones although the quality isn't going to be the same and the real world difference with the pro Max is that you just have to take two or three steps back what you can now do as my cameraman James is demonstrating is Jump between all the different lenses while shooting at 4K 60. previously you couldn't go to ultra Wide Auto photo depending on which one you started with but now at the highest resolution and frame rate you can switch between them all and I'm kind of curious how it looks going between those lenses just darting in and out obviously I can't see but hopefully you'll let me know in the comments what do you think how's that five times stability although I had hoped they'd have made some changes and upgrades to the Cinematic Mode still stuck to 4K 30 no prores or log options it still looks pretty good particularly in nice lighting but there is no kind of new next-gen mode of cinematic where if you shoot regular video you can then add depth stuff afterwards maybe next year I'm also pleased to see that they have slightly reduced the lens flare it's definitely still there and we get those sort of light floaters as I call them but in this particular shot you can no longer see the camera lens outline but what do you think of this new camera system would it tempt you to upgrade another upgrade is actually the price it's now cheaper or at least here in the UK Apple always set their prices by US Dollars first and then look at other currencies and adjust for inflation and tax and things but the iPhone 15 the regular one is actually 50 pounds cheaper now in the UK starting at 799 down from 849 the 15 Pro is 100 quid cheaper it's now starting at 999 rather than 1099 and the 15 Pro Max is actually the same price 11.99 but now with 256 gigs of storage anyway let's wrap up this review should you buy a 15 pro and pro Max well it all depends if you do an upgrade how old is your current phone I reckon anyone with an iPhone 11 or older yes go for it in terms of the Pro versus the pro Max for me it comes down to the bigger battery that's why I want this guy and also I prefer the bigger screen which is actually now a lot more comfortable to use because of the sort of smaller form factor but I reckon even if as a package it's not that significantly different from 14 pro Max the there are lots of nice incremental upgrades and as I say with the pro GPU with USBC this is kind of like the new Baseline for iPhones if you buy anything older without USBC you can restricted to last gen stuff but what do you reckon are you tempted to upgrade have you already ordered one let me know what you make of the new 15 Pros in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat\",\n",
       " \"Apple introduced four new iPhone 15 now in a bright pink color and with a matte cover with a USB-C connector but slow like Lightning, a dynamic island like on the iPhone 14 Pro, screen brightness up to 2000, also like the 14 Pro, and a 48 MP camera with two times the optical zoom.  you won’t notice the difference from the camera of the 14 Pro But the price of the iPhone 15 is the same as the iPhone 14 from 80,000 and 90,000 for the plus version iPhone 15 Pro i15 Pro Max is now made of titanium color of the year titanium gray dimensions compared to the 14 Pro have not changed dimensions remained the same here fast type  -c transmits up to 10 Gbit per second instead of a lever, a customizable button for switching modes so that it does not accidentally work; it must be held and not pressed like other buttons; it has very thin frames. But this is not yet noticeable; the processor 17 Pro is so powerful that a new Assassin's Creed will be released  first on iPhone and then on consoles\",\n",
       " 'tomorrow the sales of the new iPhone 15 Pro start and Apple writes even less to save ink on my stickers and it loses the price by 800%, and we see that Titanium Blue is just as difficult to convey as last year’s purple edges and the back cover is now velvety, there is no feeling of new sharp edges like the 14 Pro had, now the edges are smooth to hold the iPhone  it’s nicer and fits in the hand, it’s more convenient there are no symbols because this is the American version, only there is a 5G antenna on the right side of iPhones for other countries, including Dubai Of course it will be But in the main feature of the new usb-c connector I didn’t see anything unusual  The camera module connector does not look larger and the kit includes a white braided USB-C cable for 1 m and one white apple',\n",
       " \"okay so this is going to be the most expensive Tech visor video yet because we got four new iPhones Jokes Aside Apple launched four iPhone series but the biggest upgrade is with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max and we also got the iPhone 15 Pro to see the most popular white titanium color sorry natural titanium now just like any other flagship there's nothing great in this the natural titanium iPhone paperwork white Apple stickers and look who's here type c to type c cable a braided one which is good but here's the most interesting part if you look at the back of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max it says assembled in China whereas for the base iPhone 15 it is assembled in India and that's why if you compare with the USA pricing the base iPhone 15 and 15 plus didn't see a price increase whereas the iPhone 15 Pro and the pro Max variants are expensive in India the iPhone 15 Pro is 1 lakh 34 990 and the iPhone 15 Pro Max costs 1.6 that is twice as much as USA like this is a z-fold five it is almost two phones in one it is cheaper than the iPhone 15 Pro Max but now prices aside for all the Made in India stuff like the iPhone finally has Type C iPhone can play console level games iPhone this iPhone that and we have already made a video on it but the tldr is the iPhone 15 base variant this one this is a really good update over the last year's iPhone 14. and this iPhone 15 Pro Max well it is the ultimate iPhone you can buy but I'm sure you already knew that so this will be a different video because we'll be looking at the bigger picture here and answer two major questions with the iPhone 50. from a practical standpoint what are the exact upgrade and the changes and if you are an Android User should you jump ship and switch to an iPhone number two if you're already an iPhone user should you upgrade to the newer iPhone 15 series well if you are not already in the Apple Store queue you have all the answers for you rhyming so stick around till the end of the video let's go now personally I'm not a fan of any iPhone color this year like this is the blue color it almost looks like white why would you call it blue if it's white although I do like the black color on the iPhone 15 black looks like black in the Pro variant the natural titanium looks the best in my opinion but again look such subjective like Sans says he loves the pink color but now all of this apart I would say there are three things with the new iPhone 15 series which the Android Fanboy inside me finds pretty interesting like the iPhones being I've seen now like all of the Apple devices can now be charged with just one cable but yes a couple of very interesting things number one if you connect an iPhone to an iPhone the iPhone with the higher battery will charge the iPhone with a lower battery if you connect any watch accessory tws it will charge all of them at four and a half to five watt and now if you connect an Android phone it's random in our case it was charging Android phone every single time no matter the charging percentage and this is the closest we have come to a Samsung Apple collab like all thanks to type c Now Android phones also have this option called charge connected device where you can force to charge iPhone I mean options for the user in Android now this type c is a big move because now you can charge the iPhone from any type c cable up until now iPhones had the lightning Port which was invented by Apple and apple made a small royalty fee of every official lightning accessories sold out there so it wasn't for the environment it was for royalty this should stop with type c now second the iPhone 15 has USBC but it's the slow USB 2.0 Port the Pro Models get the USB 3.0 Port now of course the reason is the base iPhone gets last year's a16 chip which doesn't support USB 2.0 but come on Apple it's 2023 USB 2 for a flagship smartphone is an L like USB 2 was invented in 2000 this is 2023. now we'll come to the performance section in just a moment but before that this type c Port here brings a lot of new things to the table like for starters see here is the base variant now I can connect this dongle connect an HDMI cable and boom you have iPhone on the TV plus you can also connect a controller to the iPhone and play games on this larger display now yes it is not as full-fledged as Samsung's decks but I understand better than the previous iPhones now yes while most of these features were already there in Android for a long time it is good to see them on an iPhone see get it see moving on to the cameras we took quite a few pictures with all the iPhone 15 series and I would say camera is a bigger upgrade this year than last time like all the variants now have a 48 megapixel camera even the base iPhone 15 and the pictures look sharper even the HDR has gotten better from the last time now we'll mostly talk about the iPhone 15 Pro Max series because it has the biggest camera upgrade we'll talk about the iPhone 15 later in some another video like now if you see here the iPhone 15 Pro Series Now by default takes 24 megapixel photos like now they are sharper and the iPhone 15 Pro Max now has better Zoom you get a 5x telephoto camera instead of a 3X telephoto camera and damn that 5x portrait photos and even these bird shots are very good but few things to note Apple advertised that this iPhone 15 Pro Max has seven lenses in one that straight up marketing BS like if you go into the camera app and you tap on One X it goes to 1.2 x again if I tap on it it goes to 1.5 x this doesn't mean that This 1.2 x 1.5 x are different camera lenses they are the same camera lenses and they are just being cropped in if this was an Android brand imagine the internet would have gone crazy on it but Kudos were due like it is better than simply digitally cropped photos like see I've clicked a picture of my t-shirt here in normal mode and then this is zoom mode and if I digitally zoom into the normal mode picture see it looks soft whereas the actual Zoom shot has more clarity so apple is doing that software magic over here and the most interesting feature is this like I genuinely loved it if you click a picture of a human subject in this normal mode later on if you go into the photos you can go over here and convert a normal photo into an actual portrait photo you can actually change the focus in the photos you can even adjust the blur level this automatic portrait also works in selfie camera as well but few caveats here like this automatic portrait mode won't work in non-human subjects like this bottle over here or this busier my girl she's sad about it so for non-human subjects you'll still have to go to the portrait mode to get that fake blur other than this since you get the type C Port you can actually connect an SSD to the iPhone and directly record video on it but it only works if you're recording a prores video which is totally understandable now yes as an Android Fanboy 200 megapixel 100x zoom and this Focus change thingy it already existed on Vivo so Android has been doing all of this stuff quite a while back but you know when Apple does it Apple does it in a proper organized way so we'll see more of this camera in a proper camera review or comparison and finally performance the base iPhone 15 gets last year's processor a16 the new iPhone 15 Pro comes with the all new three nanometer a17 Pro chip and here's the funny thing see all the variants starts from 128gb except for pro Max series all the base variant of iPhone starts from 128gb meaning you pay 1.35 lakhs and all you get is 128 GB I mean like come on Apple we have Motorola g84 launched this month at 20 000 starting at 256 GB base varying well maybe the EU can look into this as well more storage space anyways back to Performance so we ran into two Benchmark and here's how much the base iPhone 15 scores and this is iPhone 15 Pro Max and just to give you a perspective you also had a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone and the scores are good and all but if you look at the detail score the 8 Gen 2 beats the a17 pro in terms of Graphics which is very interesting like Android processor is better than iPhone this year now let's try something new so we'll hook up the iPhone to a big TV here first up let's try my favorite Genji impact that oh my God it looks so big on this TV screen but you know now you can pair the PS controller to the iPhone and what would be good like a good car racing game like grid hold on dude it's so like well optimized I can see the vibrations on the controller and whenever I cross over these red lines or this grass there is that vibration of the texture and even the buttons are Auto optimized like if I have to look back see the latency is like almost zero too minimal I can't even feel the difference when I click the buttons now of course the controller support depends from game to game so if the game supports it really well it works like a charm so yeah gaming experience is pretty good on the pro series plus Apple announced that later in the year they will bring actual console level games to the iPhone Pro Series Resident Evil 4 Village and Assassin's Creed Mirage that is huge and playing those games on an iPhone is going to be mind blowing but the battery life goes like like we played for one hour on the TV and battery life if you see in this screenshot went from 80 to 10 percent in just one hour so yeah that was our first impression of the new iPhones now to answer the question are the new iPhones worth your money well see the iPhone 15 base variant starts from 79 900 rupees and it does have quite a lot of upgrades compared to last year's iPhone so if you have the budget and really want the good iPhone I think iPhone 15 is the best and the default iPhone to go for this year 2023 but if you want to save money and still get a good iPhone I would say the iPhone 13 is a good choice it currently sells for 52 full double line on Flipkart as of shooting this video but during the upcoming Big billion Day Sale it will come down even further below 50 000 or 45 000 so that also will be a very good option and well the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max is for enthusiast Apple people then are better Android alternatives at a cheaper price like the Samsung s23 Ultra or the Z flip the full series they have even more storage but who am I kidding if you want to buy an iPhone you will buy an iPhone and there's nothing wrong in that now let us know which Android phone do you want us to compare with this I think s23 Ultra or s23 with the base iPhone makes really good sense on that note this is perfect signing off from a very expensive video see you in the next one foreign foreign\",\n",

       " \"iPhone 11 iPhone 12 iPhone 12 pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 pro Max and it's the iPhone 15 and we only got the little one, no Adriano, but we also got the 15 pro Max, even it's sealed, look here, it's sealed and  we're going to open it together with you so let's go to the tururu [Music] iPhone 15 pro Max is sealed, right, because there's not enough money on this table anymore, right? Including people from the channel, how are you, yes, we have a small, small sample  here's money on our table, right? That's what I want your comment to be there. The estimated value of how many reais are on this table, remembering that the 11 is no longer sold but it's still here and its used version can still be found and everything  so it's here because yes because it's a very popular iPhone But it would be from the 12th onwards that it would be valid on this table, you know one thing that I find funny about everyone Look, look at the box, right, the boxes, all the short ones from the iPhone 11, right, because at that time Still  It 's not a charger, but taking advantage of the fact that we're nervous Here this is the case for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the most expensive, the most complete and most everything, Titanium 11, I thought it was interesting. Since I was there, why not make this unnecessary effect and without any point of put the 11 pro Max side by side just in case you're going to go away and do the unboxing of this here guys so let's go [Music] Wow, it looks like the same price live Interesting, it doesn't look exactly the same thing, right? We've had it over the years  previous ones, at least now I'm being serious with you, because these are first impressions, we put them all together precisely for this reason, avoiding putting your fingers in, right, to stain everything that is an iPhone, it has this magic, right, just one finger makes it all gooey, unfortunately, it ends up like that, sorry, I think it's funny  The issue is that it has reached a point where the user is returning to Apple Boxing and it's not being what I expected, it's interesting, it's interesting, it's interesting. For everyone else, yes, it is, but I think that on the iPhone 12 you had a miniaturized effect, exactly what you had to expand over time, but it's the same thing, let's go That one on the side There's just one problem, right?  God forbid, right, we're here, yes, everything's already done, the deal is here, there's the little button here to turn it on and off Let's go to the other side and we have it, look at the big button that's new this time, right, it's Action Look  just what a cool thing you wanted to see, here, he stains, what a strange thing, you can see that he looks a little shitty, at least with his hand. Sweaty, I had a sweaty hand, he was, and we're going to the last moment that many are waiting to see  it's what it's what it's what it's what Please camera camera oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh look if it's not the usbc input People for the love of God who would have thought that I saw this happen Adriano witnessed it with his  own eyes the entrance doesn't smell it doesn't smell like lite or for example So you want to bare it which is to bare it like this [Music] Hello Okay now just make the necessary settings but yes officially This is the iPhone 13 pro Max connected with the Expensive USB SBC, right? Exactly, for sure, and since this year we have the SBC. We also have some differences here in the box because now, right, before we come to the lighting cable, and now what comes to the usbc cable? Now this cable is braided, meaning it's a better quality cable, something that we ended up not seeing much in the likes, but then we leave it alone, right? The things we always said was that Apple's original cable was one of the most fragile on the market and there were always comments saying You're wrong, it doesn't make sense, the cable is sold well Damn, Apple itself changed it, people, look how cute the SBC is ugly  Hmm, wow, I can't believe what I'm seeing at this moment, I don't know, there are so many moments that seem like a braided collective hallucination. And like, it lasted two weeks and broke, let's continue here with an unboxing And for the rest it was And for the rest we have the deadline that comes at the time which is this little card with all the information also saying that it no longer has the chip drawer, right?  for you to put the e so for you to put your chip sorry now only the e is valid and yes and that's it and the final sticker [Music] [ Music] look at the usbc cable that comes with it I'm twisting it on purpose that's not possible to say from here  that ours is an Apple revolution because the Apple user can always buy a Lightning from baseus of any other brand braided this cable that you see doing this here right away this shows that there was a problem with what was there before and that now  wow, this was redone here It didn't go well and you get your cable in peace, ready and more than that I remember that one of the main parts that caused problems with this damn cable when it was Lightning was right at this joint here, right at the connector here  in this part here along with the wire this here guys is where mine broke, it's like bad contact, right Whoever broke it a week later started to have bad exact contact, so just the fact that it's braided makes you really notice Look, it starts better, it's another  really, the fact that it comes braided is another thing, another quality and there is no way we can't say that this is a difference from the fact that the 15 pro Max is not from the 15 line in general because it is because before the cable was a firefighter, I will agree  with me that the cable was a firefighter and now it is no longer a firefighter. This is very good, in addition to the cable, of course, the USB Type-C input, right ? the blessed Action Burn that is here on the side of the iPhone but one of the main factors that people had said about the promex is that the phone became very heavy over the generations and with all the others that are here on the table you can see  that in terms of design they really have nothing to add, it's really More of the Same, it's exactly what we've seen in Apple for a few years since I didn't even say it, since here in 12, I mean, it's in fact in 12, we already see a  very similar design basically it's just a redesign and kind of the same thing adding some different points now there's the issue, damn if I can balance it it 's not a problem they have it in the same design Because there's a rule that says you don't have to fix what  It's not broken So it's okay if you don't like the design of the iPhone Ah, it's a problem of taste, not the product, honestly, the thing here, honestly, for me, everyone is wrong because the broken camera will get scratched without a case, but the Pro Max over time  it has gained the reputation of being a heavy phone so here we have a non-scientific and not accurate scale and it's not to pretend precision it's just for reference so based on this deviation that we may have on the lemon weighing scale because this one we're going to get an iPhone 15  for Max, which costs R$ 1,200 scales currently guys, just reminding you, we are going to use our scales here to weigh the iPhones, but of these models that we are going to weigh, the 15 and 15 pro Max do not have films, I know it may seem like  It doesn't make any difference, but it does. the difference in their weight with the film and without beauty 221 grams 221 grams by comparison Adriano I put 13 for Max then I think my cell phone is a small brick let's see if it really made that much of a difference just for Our Lady, right, just getting the same size  It's one thing, let's go to 251, boy, isn't it a lot? The funny thing is that their body, right? It really maintains its size. But in fact, the 13 Pro Max generation is sensitive to the difference when you hold it in your hand, and the other one, we have the 14 Pro Max here too. where is it that it did n't even appear, right? almost the same thing, let's take the 151 degrees in the weight of the 13 pro Max, same thing, look how interesting, take a small brick. But it's interesting to see that the idea in this model here is that combining the titanium chassis with a mixed chassis  aluminum, finally, make it a little lighter, that is, in my theory, it could be as heavy as there is even more battery. of the iPhone but here you objectively have a huge lighter device but in case anyone is wondering let's take here the 15 the 15 15 Wow 170 G normal red here o red normal red 70 nu 15 normal versus 14 normal 179 is already in the model, right?  smaller, there wasn't much of a difference This is the exact normal 13, pink 182 Wow, it's good that the numbers aren't the same, right? Cool, very good, the weighing finished, even with film, everything else, you saw that the weights still have a difference and that  it's lighter even now we can protect it now that you saw the original weight and everything else, just take it, including people, this one is mine, the same one, the 13 for Max, this one is the 15 for Max, when I really hold them both  It makes a lot of difference It may not seem like it, but on a daily basis, this is even more so now that I discovered it at night. Exactly, I discovered Crossfire Road now, until then, I hadn't discovered it. used on the face in the middle of the night, so this would help me to barely break my nose in these situations, given all this, let's just leave 15 in the scene So now that you've seen them more than once, well, so we got them, we decided to get the  We were on that question Adriano that we thought So we said, well, since we're going to test, we're going to get the 15 line, why don't we get the most basic model, which is the 15, right, the base of everything there, get the 15 for the Max, which is  the top of the line, right, like the best off iPhone at the moment, precisely so we can have here as a comparison for you what exactly is the difference between the two extremes, right, what do we have here as a difference between these two devices Starting here in this case with the iPhone 15 it has the look of an iPhone 15, why do I say this, if you look at the back of it you can see that it no longer has it, it is very similar to the previous models 14, everything else is this glass back here, right, the iPhone always  it had this glass back So it's still cute and it looks like a simpler cell phone Especially because when we talk about Kings, look what we find here, right, the last little button for you to mute and unmute that no longer exists in the versions  pro and pro Max, look at this little button, it's something that has been around since the first iPhone, I don't think it will go away at any point because the upgrade that this button had on the 15 pro Max and 15 pro shows that Apple still likes this idea, so no  they removed it they upgraded it and in reality people were complaining for some time that this button could perform other functions because then just muting it is very annoying I wish I could put beauty Apple responded to the request you put Action Bunny you want to press and hold  there 's a function you want to press it to give new cool functions ah there will be new apps there will be new ones for sure man it's just the beginning of a button that is actually useful Just to demonstrate something obvious to you I'm going to press it once turn there  at the top that appears written now came the instruction But it's written with sound and keep pressed to mute you mute muted ah I'm clicking and it's showing that it's muted, keep pressed to toggle sound, that is, the button that was always there that  It was just a key, now in fact it's just a button, you can do more things with it always on the system and configure it for small shortcuts, exactly, but otherwise if we look at the body like the iPhone, with the exception of course what we said, right about the usbc  it practically remains the same in terms of design, you see that it has Beauty, now it has an Exu, a donkey, but now you see the volume button in the same way it always was, you can't test what we would test on the case because naturally the  button has changed so there 's no way to put the 14 pro Max cover on it because there's a little thing in place, it's always like that, right, but there's the little button to block the cameras here, which also continue to be in the same arrangement, in the same way, I said the only difference that we  In this model, it 's finally the SBC But besides the SBC and the button, we don't have any major differences here in terms of operating system, we continue with iOS 17 and iOS 17, it's the same operating system for all iPhones  If your iPhone was updated to the latest, right for the latest iOS, you will receive iOS 17, which is exactly the same as what you will have on the 15 pro on the 15 line in general, so in a way the only differences that we  see, in fact, it's a little button, the fact that it has a usbc and the body in this external part of the body is now made of titanium, which I honestly thought would stain a little less, but look, the thing is less stained than it stains, the other versions are for  For example, mine stains a lot more, but this little bug here stains invoked, right, with this generation we officially have Apple transforming last year's pro model into this year's normal model, that is, this means that all iPhones, even the 15 15 Plus, they have the  hyme that ayland that before, right in the 14 line, it was something that only the Pro I Promex had, naturally, now all the devices in the line have this function, so if you buy the most basic iPhone in quotation marks, that means the most or least pro the normal iPhone 15  you will have a good part of the resources that people made a slight emphasis on in the last generation of Smell of Vacility, so you know, in the 14th, it's not abandoning the north, but changing its format, right, because that hasn't happened now, now the screen has more use, so if you  had an iPhone 13 an iPhone 12 an iPhone 11 saw 14 said I'm not going to take it you're probably part of the large number of people who had this option until there were fewer sales on line 14 at the beginning there was news and everything and you waited for line 15  because you didn't want to have, as Pedro had said, the last iPhone with USB lightn, now it's usbc, right? 15, okay, you have the SBC But let's say it's more like that, how is it? It's because if you have the 13, you need to change the fire extinguisher on your buttocks, it's not necessary, your 3 is excellent, it's a great iPhone, but if you have an earlier version  there was some reason you don't have an iPhone and you're going to get one or it's damaged or you say no, I'm going to change it because that's fine, 15 makes sense apparently and there are people who prefer to change it sometimes even to be able to resell the old device for a very good price, no.  losing so much value so it makes sense in these cases But you commented Day name falls where Adriana it's good to point out to all of you that it's still 60 hz it's 15 15 Plus it's okay you won't have 120 hz 120 hz is still a feature that only exists on the pro  and promex, which in my opinion is a bit boring, Sky 23, a new cell phone being launched with 60 hz, I know there will be people, for example Adriano is the type of person who speaks, 60 hz for me it doesn't really make a difference on the day  Every day, if you don't play, you don't do things, you kind of put on television, I also don't think, oh my God, it's going to make that much of a difference in your life, but if you play, it's not horrible, but if you play, I already think that 120 hz is overdue.  not even more so at the time, putting this and a cell phone that is so expensive because even the iPhone 15 is very expensive even though it is the most basic in the line it is very expensive but Apple has been doing this tactic for some time exactly like Adriano said that the line  pro and promex from last year becomes the line, right? Like the normal cell phone and the Plus from the following year, so that's it, in this case we are having exactly the same problems that we had in the past, but now in the newer line, at least mine  Part to conclude what I have to comment on them, but the iPhone 11 box with an iPhone 11 on top, a lot of people comment on the irrelevance of new models and such and on persistent problems, my opinion and we are going to use this camera here, I wanted  for you to take a look at something here I'm going to put the iPhone 11 next to the 15 pro Max just so you understand look here at the iPhone 11 Look at the size of its camera does it make a difference it makes a difference to the size of the sensor on the back  which is not as big as this in terms of the amount of light that passes through the lens, look here at the 15 pro Max specifically for this monster here, he opened his eyes, right, baby, he opened his eyes, it's not brutal, the difference and so there are many generations that really  camera has improved but here we cleaned it several times it has to use a case on the first day because it sticks out for me this is a design error that everyone gets used to saying okay And all the manufacturers started doing this no  It's resolved in this generation of camera because if it doesn't scratch, you 'll scratch your lens and I don't think you want to have the experience of risking the lens, that's the first thing. Leaning against the camera, you can see the terror that this causes in your camera.  This wasn't supposed to be the standard experience of any device Oh, but you're going to use a case  It didn't have the protection for the seat and everything else was still exposed to my lens, so be careful when you go to buy one that has this little bumper higher up to guarantee with 100% certainty that it won't touch the lens on  some surface But anyway In addition to that here if I keep the other thing I was going to say is about this comparison here we have here the iPhone 15 and 15 pro Max has passed the generation of the 14 has already passed the generation of the 13 and still the sensor worse F Leader that is for the rear camera doesn't have 15 doesn't have it, a generation has already passed It 's passed the generation, it's already passed, there's more for this feature to still be on the pro Ah, but you want him to buy the pro and hear this on the 13 or seen on the 14 yet I'm listening to it on 15 because it's a useful resource You measure things with this little camera here in the room without having to measure with a ruler with anything it has practical applications there's your F back here and not having it here we came here the SBC is on both of you  You'll see that the resources are being transferred to the old processor, here's the one, the camera continues to have those things, you have to choose the next one, you want a good camera, I shouldn't have to make a choice with a resource that has been around for so long and additionally there's one more thing this promax  it is our choice for the tests along with the normal 15 because the pro in this generation became a duck because it doesn't have the promax camera once again in the feature only in the Max which it doesn't have in the producer, no pro So in this set with an eye on  We have a 5x optical lens on the ProMax and we don't have it on the Pro, which is the 3x1 optical lens on the Pro. I don't use a normal optical device, guys, this one, so those were our first impressions of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Max. Remembering that we're going to do  more content here on the Tech channel more detailed review of several things so follow us so you don't miss it and don't leave it here in the comments What did you think of Apple's new devices, right ?  an extra here, okay, we made a video about the iPhone 15 pro Max and I saw a lot of comments that I can't agree with, for example Oh, my Galaxy A10 gives this iPhone a hard time, I don't know what, those who buy it are kids like that  Guys, I've always used Android, I'm in all the videos with Android and I've never said anything about the other cities in the comments. I already said the iPhone's only flaw is the price, I don't agree with the price, I don't think it delivers what it costs, but I've said every time it's a top of the line phone it's good and whoever uses it has a working machine but the person pays for a motorcycle on a cell phone so these comments are not valid and they're not good and they're not good  for no one so honestly this is what I saw Wow give me the iPhone 15 it's just hate the iPhone is expensive and that's all those who use iPhone the iPhone have Androids Android and that's it Have you ever seen the price of a Galaxy 23 Ultra End of Story price said  all of this I'm Amanda Abreu I'm Adriano Ponte This is the iPhone 15 this is the 15 pro Max we're going to make more content about them because there are people who use these devices and we're also going to make content for everyone Just to make it very clear  Furthermore, do n't forget to subscribe to our channel, leave a like and we'll stay here for a kiss, a cheese and until next time. Enjoy and leave in the comments what you want to see, taking advantage of the fact that there are so many things to test now  with SBC Possibly What kind of crazy thing can you get us to do and also what other videos we should make on iPhone for you [Music]\",\n",

       " \"Derek Lima Leon Do you have any opinion about the new iPhone 15 and Apple's difficulty in innovating Apple announced the iPhone 15 people are a little disappointed because they wanted more what Apple is selling is not something useful for 90% of users  I think in terms of what it's adding compared to the iPhone 14 Okay, but I think I have the solution, there's a new app that was announced yesterday, it's from another company, it's not Apple, which for me saves the iPhone, it saves the iPhone, but  one way is the way is more exactly a big change in the iPhone the iPhone will now have USBC the iPhone will have USBC which is this connection here and we have had it since the S8 and the S7 I think it was the last one with micro USB Apple will  put usbc on the iPhone in the old days Apple Live in rotten which is its proprietary port which was a very bad deal people keep asking when to switch to SBC when Apple introduced Lightning it was in fact better than the micro USB that we had  but the SBC is far superior in many ways and not only does it allow compatibility with a huge range of accessories and devices, you have just one cable to charge everything, right, your laptop, your cell phone, your headphones, everything with SBC  Why didn't they adopt SBC before? Simple answer because the market for cable lines and Light devices for licensing these devices to Apple was multimillion-dollar, what they sold for cables wasn't in the book and they charged a lot, of course, of course, you there in the Brazil probably had no problem buying the Light cable in Piratão from the street vendor to connect it to your cell phone because you didn't want to pay the price that the Apple store charged, which in fact How much is it? Wow, this one, I'll get to it later, okay, it's for you  have an idea of cable prices, this is a cable, okay, folks, this is a cable, but I'm going to get the Lightning, a standard Lightning to USBC cable, 219, I count in Brazil, oh my God, I'm going to tell you, given this price, you would go and you would have no problem buying the one.  street vendor to buy or unauthorized, but in North America in Europe where people earn in dollars in euros, it's not really, people simply went to the Apple store and bought, not only that, there is a whole licensing business also for accessories and such, I don't know how to say it properly because I'm not from that side, but Apple made a lot of money. There was a huge incentive at the time to keep this Line cable, but the European Union approved a regulation that smartphones had to have a USB cable, a USB connection, because  to reduce the amount of waste, right, you use a cable for several devices Exactly everything and And then they were forced to change and the fact that they used lighting for me was a bit of an absurd thing because they started to add the function for you to record in Progress which  It's a much better video format for professional editing and such on the iPhone, but when you get your files from the iPhone because it creates a very large file, right, your video files to transfer to the PC took 1 zillion hours  because the light Mini on the iPhone worked with USB 2.0, what is USB 2.0, you ask me this one, more or less the usbc standards that we have, no, they are not all because there is no usb4 here and also these names here have already changed several times  Sometimes the people who decide on the name of the USB, like the organization, right? They're really bad at it, they've already changed the name several times, USB 2.0 has already been called 3.0, it's been called 3.1 3.2 3.2 at last, but they worked at this speed here, at 400 MB per  second 400 MB 480 MB per second is basically 60 megabytes per second it's slow as hell and that's what the iPhone had until now if you tried to remove any file from your iPhone because they want to encourage you to use other technologies including iCloud which is the  their subscription service for cloud storage so this was very complicated now they introduced this USB here with usbc which is this one they call G2 which in fact or 10 GB is much faster several times faster than the other one  There's a problem, although SBC is adopted, it's safe, this speed here is 10 GB, 10 gabits per second, it's only on the pro and promex, the normal iPhone 15, despite having the SBC, still works on USB 2.0. You'll still have this  speed right here with the new connection and if I'm not mistaken, but that's not the case, it's not just an Apple thing, it's on pro smartphones, despite having access to this speed, the cable that comes with it is still USB 2.0, you 'll have to  buy a 10 Gabi per second USB cable to be able to have the speed that the smartphone supports But this is not just an Apple thing, other Smartphone companies do this, this is also normal for the cable that comes in the box to be USB 2.0 despite the smartphone having support for 3.0 but we have to remember that Apple charges this here is Thunderbolt, okay I don't know if this here is Thunderbolt this here is for the Mac, right in the SBC 1800 what is this here it is Thunderbolt for Mike  like, it's absurd, it's absurd, this charge, for the love of God, is not exactly the one you'll need, okay, this one is a much faster car, this one is equivalent to what is usb4, right, for Mac, but it's very expensive and Apple  Cobra Expensive on these cables, this here people will buy in time like this the guy goes there to buy the iPhone then I need a cable to have this faster speed he was already buying at the Apple store he will buy from Apple they will earn a lot  money anyway this is about SBT but there's more that's interesting now is that they have the first three nanometer processor in a smartphone This one, I'm not mistaken, the first three nanometer processor which is the size of its lithography with is basically a somewhat abstract indication  but that indicates how small you can make a transistor in it, so as far as we know, the iPhone's processor will be with the smallest transius in the world, I don't know, you can say it that way, but it will be the first mass-made processors with  this new technology which is a technology from a company called tsmc because Apple develops processors but it is an example of other companies it also does not manufacture. It depends on another company manufacturing for it and tsmc is the main one in the world that makes processors for  a lot of people see AMD things like that but Apple made an agreement they must be paying a lot more to have exclusivity for time in this new technology in this three nanometer lithography but the processors in this lithograph are only those of the iPhone pro and pro  Max of the iPhone 15 without being pro and pro Max you will basically have last year's processor which is a trend that Apple started last year, if I'm not mistaken, always giving last year's processor to iPhones that are not pro  So you won't have the three dwarves, you won't have this benefit of performance gains and such, this deficiency of this new technology, they also said that this new technology will have support for Tracy hardware, here you have a scene without Ray tracing And then they go  Turn on Ray tracing and now Ray tracing understands, you see before you didn't have them. Look at the reflection of these lights from above that appear in place, this kind of orange reflection, something like that, they start to appear in various places, understand, because basically you're calculating in time  real the dynamic reflection of these lights here, obviously it's not all raytracing because these painted lights here are still there, right, but at least these lights here you're seeing their reflections everywhere, I don't know what the use of this here will be because if I  I'm not mistaken, the Snapdragon 8g2 already has hardware support but I don't know of any game that uses this, probably Apple, as it has a greater dominance in the market with standardization, will encourage someone to use it in games But I personally haven't seen it yet It's gone to have on Android I don't know of any game that actually has it and it also has the titanium thing with this guy but I want to talk about the worst thing I saw which is the camera thing because you didn't like it because they announced that now the  promax will have a periscopic camera in the style that we saw a while ago, already on Android other brands If I'm not mistaken, xiaomi has one of these ruins and has one of these nine 2020 is from the s20 which is a periscopic camera that allows a  currently on the iPhone, their telephoto camera has a three-fold zoom, but now with this periscopic camera, which is a prism that bends the light so you can place the sensor further away from the lens, which allows you to zoom further, right?  you will have a 5x zoom but that's the problem it will only come on the iPhone 15 pro Max the iPhone 15 pro doesn't have the iPhone 15 pro it still has the 3x zoom but there is a problem if you get the iPhone 15 pro Max with a 5x zoom you seriously lose the three. So it's actually a choice because if you get the promex which has the 5x zoom if you want to zoom in three what it will do is take the main camera lens and  give it a crop So in fact you will have a better 5x zoom but your 3x zoom will be worse what happened Samsung did this I think Samsung did it right when they put the I don't know how many X thing on the s20, right?  the s20 was 10 then in the note 20 it was five it kept the 3x lens So you have the perscopic lens here then you have the 3x they didn't have one here then you have the main and you have the wide angle so I thought it was kinda  complicated because it's not a necessary upgrade it's a trade but the problem is that they linked it to the size of the smartphone if you want a pro with the big screen you only have the 5x you don't have the option of the three and one thing they tried to sell  now that I found it interesting but I didn't see such a huge impact on their presentation They added this function Now that the iPhone will record in Progress like 14 it already does but it will also record to an external SSD in log I'm going to show the video here  for you to take a look, it was very interesting, the video will also be a little curious because I think this was my failure in their marketing, although Apple is very good at marketing, Apple is like, you have something that does n't work  in all other companies, it's an art Because they know how to communicate very well what their devices do, it's a problem that I think is one of the limitations that I see in Samsung's communication is that Samsung does a lot of things but Most of the people don't know, I already came to us who were users of the Galaxy S. Years ago I said, did you know that there is a Dex mode that you can connect it to the computer and use it as if it were a desktop, people have never heard of it, oh Apples  all the little things that Apple does, you know, I remember when they introduced proless, which is this video codec, right, it's very good, that professionals use it, you have it on the iPhone, I'm also saying that the iPhone does exactly professionals, but it is.  one more I saw people who didn't even know what they were going to use this for saying did you know that there is I say it like this you make professional videos no but there is the person knew because Apple knows how to communicate well but here what I want to comment on is this thing  what they did here, for cinema, right? They want to show this cinema function, it was very good. The video even made a cinema scene, but the guy is filming with the iPhone, then the production person runs away with HD, she took the HD from the iPhone.  and someone is already saying something like that, that 's not what you want to see, you want to pay attention to the background and they're going to do it from here, here the person goes and records it on an external HD, right in 4K You can record up to six k and things like that up to 60, sorry, 60 frames at 4K And then they show a whole movie scene and such and then the person takes the HD, takes it out of the camera, takes the HD that is stuck there, the camera is stuck in a stabilizer, hands it over there and the guy starts it up and  Now open it in da Vinci, solve it then for some reason the guy will start doing color correction when the last thing you 're going to do is review, yes, editing, maybe to cut something he did, it's obvious, it's not to show that you record on vlog  Okay guys, my criticism here is that they took it and now you can make a cinema in your house, so and so. Because this film is like a cinema, I only need 100 million dollars to hire this team. It's not really like that in the sense of ha ha, what  I think it looks strange in terms of communication because if it showed, for example, someone doing a journalistic article, right? That would be the most useful thing. Ah, maybe even a YouTube video, something plus an Indian short, something like that, I think it would make more sense, but then they get it.  something that we do Where's the key, you understand that we do crazy business with a little camera, I understand what they tried to do, right?  The cost of the camera here is the last concern you have, right? It's true, but it's interesting. I understand why they did that. The person coming here is filming.  That's it, people saw, like, very few people have an application for this, I do, and I would be interested, but I saw that there was a lack of communication there to talk about the value of this, too, I think, but it's increasingly difficult for everyone who makes a smartphone.  It's not just for Apple to justify the new format the new device because apart from the foldable ones that are still in place, it's still a market that still has a lot of room for innovation because the slab smartphone format is consolidating, right ?  We already have the final format of the thing, all the Improvements we make, they are like peripherals, right, they are too small, it is difficult to justify something new and not only that, Apple has this problem, which in the iPhone's main selling points is performance  So now they want to put triple-A games on the iPhone. They're going to put Resident Evil and stuff like that, who's going to pay like 50 dollars for Resident Evil to just play it on a screen this small, right? The great thing about the Switch is that you can plug it into your  television too, right? I think it's complicated because now the level of performance that smartphones have is already enough for 99% of people, 99% of people would come with and live with the performance of a processor from, I don't know, four years ago, right? There was a time when  every time your new Smartphone is used to consume social media for professionals, yes you would need it but There was a time when you justified buying a smartphone every year based on performance because you had a transition the first smartphones used a setup box processor that connects to the television the first  iPhone used a Samsung box, it even connects to the television to have other channels and things like that, it's a streaming service and so on, so the performance you had for several years wasn't enough using a smartphone, it was a commitment, it was just clicking and waiting, right now?  No, now a smartphone, that's how you can buy a Smartphone cheaper and that's enough, but there's one thing I have to say, which is the following, at least for a person like me, a company did something really innovative, it's the following yesterday, black Magic, which is a company that makes da Vinci, solves this application here where they show the editing of the video here, including this table here, they also sell this application This color editing application is from Black, which is a company that makes  a lot of camera things they launched a new camera including also 6k full frame they make cameras very cheap Type 6 offers 2500 for very cheap for a camera they do studio things too and they make several cameras including several things that you watch broadcast  on the internet things like it's done with their equipment and they also make the da Vinci Resort which is the editor that I use that has that color correction thing and so on.  but what they announced is this, just try to enter iPhone, give me this on Android, please. We call it you being in the background of gaga, right, something like that, it's a black Magic that we use to film that, this app here is an app that gives you all the manual camera control functions on your smartphone, and you can  Doing a lot of things has the entire digital interface and you can even talk to the people who are producing things with you. It's a trip. But there is one, but they have a service called black Magic Cloud, which is their cloud service. Look here  What can you do with a Smartphone? Smartphone and it will show what you are filming with the clouds automatically, not just with the clouds it will sit with a project within the video editor so I can be filming something here I have someone working on editing somewhere else in the world  I just filmed it, now feel everything with the clouds and it appears within the video editing project for the person on their computer, I 'll show you how it works, let me see here, this one is the da Vinci visual, they make this application and it  There's a whole suite here that you can use, you have it here, for example, this is the editing part, right? So all the things I edit, so on, you come here now and there's this is the special effects part. here also for coloring you can do color correction here you will have some here there are some little color corrections that I made there is one that I spend a lot of time I am learning trying to improve the audio quality of my videos So you have it here  all the videos to correct the audio too And in the end you come here and render it and what they are doing is that you film with this application you will pay there is a monthly subscription which you are not mistaken is 15 dollars for 500 GB that's it  good as hell, as soon as you stop at the stop you can send it, yes, man, you can simulate the original file or make a proxy, which is a smaller version of the file you recorded and the editor starts working on it, it appears within his project.  It's moving here in the Puff edition The image has arrived, edit things and such, you can send a chat to communicate with it and say what you want within the application itself and it's only available for the iPhone. I'm going to talk about how this is innovative because, for example, imagine that  you are a video a video journalist video reporter you are on the street you can now that you have USB if on the iPhone connect your receiver via usbc be it DJ's something like that on the Smartphone you can control the audio level on it you can also put your  reporter, right, speaking to the camera, you film it with all these manual controls, as soon as you finish it, you send the file, so you can have an editor in the newsroom just to receive your file, start editing, there is no longer this scheme of you having to go back to writing to deliver to the editor You could only start editing after you got there and it has all the professional formats it records in Progress up to 444 it records in h264 and h265 for the guys you have to upload something quickly, right, that's impressive and it's all combined because this  company, they control an application and they also control the video editor and the service and the server in the clouds so it's all together, everything talks and the most impressive thing is that it's all apart from his cloud subscription which is per month at 15 dollars for 500  GB it's all a membership fee you buy the editor and that's it you buy the editor if I get 300 it's not a subscription you pay once you have it forever and the Smartphone app is free No it's not free in the free version it's free that's it I want Doubtless, if this were if this were a presentation, if you were at Apple's presentation, destroy it because, like, what do people today, your biggest problem, especially people who work with video, right? It's like, coordinating things with whoever is  on the street, so backup is so easy and it's already within the project, not only that, if you want to mix images from a professional camera, there will be a camera that will be compatible with this service, you will be able to send it directly from the camera, there is only one that is  a Black doctor for now, but this way, if you have something filming a professional camera, you can then go to the computer and upload the file from your camera to the ubers and the person, the editor, will have the files from the smartphone and the camera on the other side, it will speed up  Otherwise, the process you can just upload the proxy which is a smaller version of your file to upload faster if you have data limitations for the editor to start working and then you go to where the editor is, hand over the smartphone and it will download the files integers and just replace them in the program with the original file and it will have everything in the complete step resolution that this burns, for example thinking about the journalism production system for example and the amount of opening up possibilities for Independent media to act because you eliminate  at a cost of investment in equipment that was inhibiting, you understand initiatives and now it's kind of democratized a lot, it expands a lot, it's impressive, even if you have it, you get the smartphone, in this case, it only has it for the iPhone, so far it has one day for Android. Honestly, don't worry.  They said it's exclusive, right? No, they launched first. Now, they do n't have any exclusivity with Apple, including the Android editor. where I know It runs better on the Mac It's because it's easier for them to adapt because the amount of hardware on the Mac It's smaller, right, it's not like Windows, which has every combination of processor and video card possible that you can imagine, it's impressive because you  buy a little lace like the one the guy had in the video pro o pro pro in this case it will have to be the iPhone there is no way you guarantee stability guarantee stability you buy an ND filter which is for as there is no lock there is no diaphragm in law you  You have to control the light in some way to make it better, it's not necessary but the quality is better so you can use the right shutter speed, you connect via USB a microphone, the receiver puts the transmitter either on the microphone or not on the lapel, I'm not going to the reporter to talk  In this case, if it was someone doing journalism or you yourself, you can hold the camera here in the vlog, right, and place where it appeals to you here. I'll record whatever you want at the moment you clicked Stop. I think you can even program it to be automatic. Send it now.  It's going up, you're going to do the next subject and the best part is to provide security too because no one will be able to take your card, right? memory he has to fight for the tape and someone pulls the tape on one side and pulls the tape on the other, so this happens when someone relaxes and just nods, it was with the police or with other actors. The police are logically clear, so you put about 5g  even more so for the people who do it for television you only need to do full HD only when full HD h265 When you were arrested there in Greece if that had happened you couldn't have deleted it I deleted the file here it had already been uploaded understand I even have it to this day the file is because you don't know I was detained I wasn't almost arrested I was in fact detained I was detained for a while they decide whether to prosecute me or not because I filmed a military base in Greece without knowing then when I was leaving the base I took my cell phone  and I just recorded my reaction at the time at the stage for the company but I was so upset that I went later and deleted it and I told him to let him, he will have to do the simulation again but anyway, if I had this system I wouldn't lose material, you know, it would be  oh, heaven, the next trip we take, we have to have a system like this working on our cell phones, this is sensational, this one that black Magic did, it's a company like this, that's why I've never regretted having made the conversion, okay guys, I came from  from Adobe Premier I made the transition to Da Vinci da Black Adobe Premier is Adobe basically controls the market for this market of internet production, things like that, even TV, they have like, I don't know, 80, 90% of the market, but then I decided  switching to this other editor mainly because it's not by subscription, right, I pay once and it's always there and then it's cheaper and it's not because Adobe charges it doesn't seem more expensive for the company here so I could put it as a company expense I had to subscribe  as a company I paid, like, a lot more than an individual person, it doesn't make any sense because it's the same application, but then I made this transition and I actually think it's worth it because now we 're getting almost all of my  the whole system talking to each other because this company not only makes software but also makes hardware, I also have his desk for things like changing the camera and so on, so it was really worth it now with this I'm just going to wait for it to arrive on Android because honestly  I can't give up the Ultra at all because after I did the track in Greece and the 10x camera saved my life a lot of times, not even the professional camera I was carrying in my hand had a zoom to reach I can't give up and I really want this on Android, it's going to be wonderful\",\n",

       " \"iPhone 15 yeah the cat iPhone 15 we say the terms or not we take it with a grain of salt we don't take it I think that the heights and everything there they will they will shoot me bullets iPhone 15 burst I will only take it if they give it to me but  otherwise I never buy it never it burst so that's how it is stainless steel let's go in fact quite a few changes which make the iPhone 15 very interesting number says that it's the best iPhone in years and I 'm  agree with that on paper the list of new features and not super long but each is relevant there is dynamic Island which is a marvel of design in addition to being a very useful feature to follow the progress of your uber eats delivery person the score  of a match or the information of a flight the main camera goes from 12 to 48 megapixels this is not only good news for the quality of the photos their sharpness and the management of low light it is also what allows have a x2 zoom without the need for a third sensor in terms of performance you have the processor of the iPhone 14 pro which is a war machine and you can keep it for years finally it charges via usb-c no more cables  of iPhone everyone has the same here for the main new features we agree nothing revolutionary but I don't think that's what we expect from this model the innovation is pyramidal at its peak you have the latest technologies  which are expensive but which over time will be integrated into more affordable products at the top of the pyramid we find the product reserved for professionals or enthusiasts who will pay more to have the latest news the iPhone pro at the center the product intended for the general public  who still likes to have fun the iPhone 15 what we expect from an iPhone 15 is not kylinove it is that it gets as close as possible to the Pro model as quickly as possible to be able to get close to  the best experience for less money and at this level it is a success because with the exception of the screen and a different camera system the iPhone 15 is scaple knew how to do better last year for €300 less but if what we want to judge is pure innovation we have to look at the most advanced model the iPhone 15 pro and on that I have things to say we will see if the generation  'iPhone 15 is exploded this video is in collaboration with the only application you need setup because this step gives you access to more than 230 Mac and iOS applications with a single subscription no need to spend 20 minutes on a forum to find the  best application to manage your emails you can ask the setup assistant in one click you install it and you have access to the premium version of lap on your Mac and your iPhone each application is validated by this app and the selection is enriched  constantly among my latest discoveries Spark email application which now integrates artificial intelligence functions to write them for you and the faces to correct your writing or modify the tone to be more professional always with links and quickly heading which under  -title a video in seconds to optimize it for social networks you can get lost in their intelligent selection regardless of the number of clothes you use the subscription price remains the same 9 dollars 99 per month and with  the link in description you have a 7 day free trial THANK YOU at this stage for supporting the channel this year the iPhone 15 Pro has undergone four major changes the use of titanium the processor the cameras and obviously the adoption of USB  -c the European Union forced Apple to abandon its Lightning collector in favor of USB-C which is a universal standard what this means is that you can now charge your iPhone with the same cable as a computer a  iPad a phone from another brand and most electronic devices I personally opposed this law for two reasons the first is that I fear the regulation on innovation because if tomorrow there is a wind a connection  revolutionary she will also not be able to use it and because I do not believe in the ecological arguments put forward by Europe to justify this decision I made two videos on the subject which I put in description but the arrival of the  'usb-c on the iPhone is still good news I don't think it will change your daily life but you will be happy to be able to charge your iPhone with any cable if you have forgotten yours at home and you can now charge  airpods an Apple watch or even another iPhone from an iPhone too but it's reserved for the iPhone 15 pro its USB port is 20 times faster than the old connection it doesn't change the charging speed but it speeds up considerably the data transfer they could have done the same on the iPhone 15 they were radar on this but they consider that professionals need high transfer rates and for once it is true because camera level the  iPhone 15 Pro has been boosted Apple has added intermediate focal lengths between the different lenses to allow very versatile shots without losing quality. The iPhone 15 Pro has this different shooting thanks to intelligent software tips while retaining  only three photo lenses the second photo innovation is reserved for the iPhone 15 pro max which is regrettable because it is very useful the third sensor of the iPhone 15 pro max is a periscope lens which corresponds to a 5x zoom in  In fact, they placed prisms inside the lens to deflect the light 4 times before the sensor catches it, which gives a 5x zoom in a lens that remains compact, it is not only very useful for taking photos  from afar but that also makes it a very interesting device for portrait photography the third innovation is perhaps the one I prefer it concerns video the iPhone 15 Pro can film in log a raw colorimetric profile which retains more details in  the highlights and shadows providing more flexibility for colorimetry in editing which makes me finally consider using the iPhone as a secondary camera on the go because I've seen images that I would never have attributed to a smartphone  well it is time to talk about titanium a change of material is not just due to a desire to renew the design of a product it contact on the experience its design and its operation we can doubt the necessity of such  material for a smartphone it will probably not change your life but I think it is relevant titanium is not a marketing choice it is a remarkable metal which has obvious qualities for the design of a smartphone the first is impact resistance titanium is a metal naturally resistant to traction and it is for this reason that it is used in particular in prostheses the second is its resistance to corrosion due to the presence of a layer of protective oxide on its surface which makes it very resistant to sea water chlorine acids and this protective layer is self-healing because it forms naturally upon exposure to oxygen titanium is widely used in  the construction of submarines in the roosters the propulsion systems and components because it is corrosion resistant the third reason is ecological the process of extracting titanium is less energy intensive than aluminum and the comes from more regulated environment in addition to being a highly recyclable material the fourth is simply aesthetic it is an elegant material and whose resistance allows the 15 pro to have thinner edges and the fifth characteristic is its lightness it can  seem counterintuitive for a more solid material but titanium is one of the materials with the best strength to weight ratio in summary titanium is a more expensive material but more durable more practical more ethical more aesthetic and lighter and if Apple says its  titanium that it is of aerospace quality it's not just marketing either it's because that's the case it respects aeronautical and space standards the iPhone 15 Pro is made of grade 5 titanium an alloy  of titanium containing 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium which further considerably improves the strength of the metal grade 5 titanium is used in aircraft and rocket engines because of its lightness and strength for that reason  does not make the iPhone unbreakable because it is still covered in green on the front and back so the main structure is very well protected the components are very well protected which obviously reinforces the durability of the product but the  titanium will not prevent you from having to go to the Apple Store if you drop it from a height Apple knows this very well because in their presentation they only mentioned how resistant titanium was as a material and they revised the architecture  internal to facilitate the repair of the rear window which he still did go from 600 euros to 200 euros so even with titanium put a shell well let's talk about an argument that will please inoxtag the processor the iPhone 15 Pro  is equipped with the 17 pro chip and it deserves its name it is the first three nanometer processor in the world which means that Apple can integrate more transistors in the same space basically it is more powerful it is useful for the photo and video capabilities for data transfer which allows for example to record videos in a professional format directly on an external medium and this is useful for gaming Apple considers the 17 pro as the biggest overhaul of 4 graphics of its history which allows you to play games that you usually play on console on an iPhone like Assassin's Creed or Resident Evil which you can play with a Bluetooth controller and on a large screen thanks to USB-C this obviously never rivals  a playstation but it is not impossible that the iPhone becomes a very interesting console you see it still makes quite a few changes we cannot say that it is trivial and I retained that what I considered to be major but stainless steel has  still right on something wait do you agree in reality I propose I do n't take any risk we might as well keep the iPhone 13 really we might as well keep the iPhone 13 but in fact it is it is not broken it is good  but there's nothing new that means you might as well keep your iPhone which he's right there's nothing revolutionary on the iPhone 15 and even on the 15 pro but that's what we call innovation  innovation is not a synonym for revolution innovation is the constant search for existing improvement 98% of the objects around you come from what is called incremental innovation, that is to say a contribution continuous small improvements computers household appliances medicines cars and even social and economic systems have all evolved incrementally by small additions innovation works this way for many reasons including return on investment competition maintenance but none of them  it doesn't come close to the main reason why innovation is incremental you do n't want change look at how the general public reacts as soon as a change is too visible the wireless of airpods the notch facial recognition the  disappearance of the Home button folding smartphones even the very concept of a touchscreen phone was rejected at the presentation of the iPhone because people especially wanted not to lose their physical keyboard human being is a creature of habit often preferring security  and the comfort of routine with the uncertainty of change its tolerance for change is inversely proportional to its desire to see it happen and this is ultimately good news because revolutions are sometimes sources of instability while innovation  incremental reinforces security, relevance and longevity of a product which is undoubtedly not the most exciting because we already know it but which is better at the same time it is precisely what Apple sells you the best  iPhone never designed stainless steel your reasoning being good you have no rational reason to change your iPhone 13 for a 15 you can keep yours but conclude that it is enough to cancel the relevance of a new model is a ticket  of generalization that is to say that you take your personal experience to form a universal conclusion but as the whole planet had not necessarily thought of buying a new iPhone at the same time as you not everyone has an iPhone 13 we  tends to compare models from one year to the next and that's normal but the popular belief that iPhone owners buy the new model every year has no basis in reality the average is  every three to four years every year people buy an iPhone but the novelty is not necessarily the cause they may just need a new phone because theirs is broken steal lost or simply starting to get worn  a little old so Apple releases a new one every year to meet the demand of those who need it at that time these people are probably very happy that the 15 exists because they will benefit from the year's result  of incremental innovation which inevitably led to the best iPhone ever designed we can discuss it in the comments but if you think that the iPhone 15 is broken it's probably because it is not intended for you thank you all thank you at this stage thanks to

       " \"foreign last section to talk about some quick stuff I feel like iPhone 15 rumors are kind of spinning up a lot it's August now it's a month away September is a month away and we are starting to get a whole bunch of the most interesting iPhone 15 stuff I kind of want to summarize it all I think iPhone 15 Pro also is the more interesting one definitely because that seems like the one we're gonna where we're gonna see the most new stuff so I'll just I'll scroll down this list a little bit for you guys and maybe give me your reactions I'll also have some of my own first reaction thinner bezels do we care it's not care so much 30 thinner bezel slightly thinner bezels I mean it's cool the most we get to full screen full screen it's better it's gonna look just like the the old phone just a slightly thinner bezel it's one of those things that'll look nicer we'll all see it and be like that's really nice no one else will like really yeah understand it yeah yeah I mean 30 of that small of a bezel already yeah and already uniform bezels not super you know not amazing but okay cool uh titanium frame so moving from our precious we have aluminum on the non-pro and we have stainless steel on the pro right now titanium that's how we're feeling about is that what the Appalachian Ultra is made of uh let's look it up I think it's titanium it's obviously super important also my Fuji film tx1 is titanium and I really like that material isn't there a song called titanium Apple watch Ultra is made with titanium that's right as they call it Aerospace grade that's because they use titanium they use titanium in space so now it's Aerospace great titanium okay like I can say you use uh Aerospace grade mayonnaise mayonnaise exactly they probably got different mayonnaise in outer space yeah they have regular mayonnaise anything liquid has differences yeah Mania is kind of a liquid so anyway titanium phone how do we feel about uh slightly different material it's gonna be lighter because that lighter than steel okay that's good yeah it's a game changer I think I'm gonna go to the whole Apple ecosystem this feels like one of those things where like Apple knows they can't or don't want to make the phone exactly the same as last year so they need something to make it look and feel just a little different from last year so you know that's the new one they don't use the S model any the S thing anymore right so every year they actually do have to do something slightly different like from 12 to 13 they made the um the notch smaller 13 to 14 they made Dynamic Island right 14 to 15. so now every year you get at least a slight change in look yeah and I think that's so people because that's the app it'll be like that's the new one exactly that's exactly I literally think that's the primary thing they're trying to accomplish with that it is it's like every year you have to have that like note at the end of the video like if you're upgrading from last year it's probably not worth it because it's only this minuscule difference this year it's gonna be like it's titanium yeah if you really want titanium upgrade yeah other than that smaller bezels and slightly smaller but I'm sure it'll have a better camera but yeah here's one we've talked about a little bit but we can give a quick synopsis action button might be replacing the mute switch but you could have it be a mute yeah so we didn't talk about that last time we just talked about it having an action button but now the rumor is that button will be replacing the mute switch um I think yeah it could be the mute switch it could be something else I think it would be really sick if you could map that to like your focus mode or even a GPS location so doesn't the Apple watch Ultra like have Dynamic uh action buttons it has the action button and you can map in the watch app what you want it to do which is a couple based on location I think we know I think that was like something we said would be really cool when that happens like imagine you're working out you're on the gym or the track that action button is relevant to where so when you're inside an app yes like if I'm in a track workout it can detect that I'm at a track and now the action button is giving me like lap timer segments but as far as just like on my home screen hit the action button it's like this will either launch a certain app or start a workout okay basically yeah but it can do a bunch of other stuff now which I think is really cool I would prefer to have a button that does multiple things than just mute a thing so yeah yeah I'm going to try my hardest to map this to Google Assistant I don't know what it's going to take you can but I'm gonna try you could probably just make a um it's probably gonna be a serious shortcut yeah yeah yeah all right so that's that what about USB type c yes it seems like it is gaining steam as a possible iPhone 15 Pro feature um and it's it's going to be hilarious as they Market it alongside a lightning iPhone 15 but they're going to be like oh you can shoot prores and you can get faster footage off of the phone this is the bet we should make because there's two options here there's two options yeah either they put USBC in both the 15 and the pro and they only put Thunderbolt in the Pro or they put it in the Pro but they keep lightning on the 50 because they do have an extra year they're they're doing it a year ahead of when the EU is making them right okay so I was thinking about iPad when you said that and in an iPad Pro it's Thunderbolt and USBC and in a regular iPad Air it's just USBC exactly but they also didn't come out at the same time so there was a brief period where there was a thunderbolt iPad Pro and a lightning iPad Air before they switched it but with this it's going to be the phones all launch at once so I think I if I'm if I'm betting I think they're gonna do J [Music] [Laughter] I'll place my bet I hope I think I'm going to be wrong but the the possibility of this happening it would be so funny if there was a lightning and a USBC I think the announce did the same thing and I'm gonna take that bet just because I assume you guys will bet the opposite and then I can bask in them it's hilarity of that happening and both of you losing I think they're equally possible it would be so funny you're the Thunderbolt and regular USBC makes so much more sense like give it you'd have to Brand it though they'd have to Brand it like Pro Data I think they're gonna brand it they're gonna it's gonna be a hilarious yeah well because remember when they finally we've had 60 hertz iPhones for an eternity and there was that moment on stage where they got to the iPhone 13 14 pro whatever it was and it was like promotion and you're like oh I see what she did there you just called 120 hertz ltpo something Pro so you can put it in the Pro phone not the bass phone but now they're stuck with it I think they can phones only yeah that's true but does that mean so is that the regular 15 will also be 60 hertz so I think that yeah yeah okay so that's interesting so if they only move USBC to the Pro phone that would imply that it's a pro feature that's never going to come that way but why else would they only put it in one of the phones you know to get you to buy it because I feel like if they only put it in the Pro phone they have to Brand it as a pro feature and that kind of gets them stuck so they have to put it in both there's already that rumor of like how how the regular phone is going to get some of these like features that are all like Dynamic Island and the hole punch will come I forget what was it like 20 20 no the dynamic island is already coming is coming to the 15 regular right because it's not a pro feature right it's just Dynamic which was my bet yeah I just want to remind so anything that they put that they brand as Pro yeah imply that they're going to keep it in the Pro forever USB type c may not be branded as Pro it could just be a dynamic port or something hilarious what they could do in the like 16 yeah what they could do in the like 16 is they could put 120 hertz but it's not ltpo it's just 60 to 120 and yeah in the regular promotion and it wouldn't be promotion interesting so I don't know regular people would have no idea what that means but yeah that's fair I I think they both I think they um I think they both get USBC yeah yeah interesting I'm willing to take the back side I love that badge for the yeah this is the the big Underdog the only possible like there is something to be said about them making the regular one still lightning because they can just milk the lightning port for a little bit longer because they're making licensing money on all of them and they'll also have a reason for people to upgrade from the 15 to the 16 when it finally gets USBC yeah because this is the thing once you get you once you get USBC on people's radar for the iPhone then it's like okay air pods all these other accessories everything else people are going to start having to think about USBC and the iPhone and so when the next one comes out they're going to have oh USBC is now in all of the iPhones all the accessories hop on board by the port and the accessories again like all that stuff Apple thinks about this a lot they definitely had this exact conversation my most anticipated moment of the iPhone event this year is how they are going to tell the world that USBC is so much better yeah I'm like so excited for this revolutionary report from the iPad Pro and we've put it in the iPhone from the Nexus 6p yeah let me put it in the iPhone to be fair we just went on a work trip and Brandon's phone died in the middle of the night because he didn't realize he brought a USBC cable instead of a lightning cable till like all of us were asleep that happened to me too this weekend yeah I literally only brought a USBC cable and I forgot to bring a lightning one and my iPhone died yeah it's like well I'm screwed the day is gonna have a slide about like one charger forever I'm still doing Johnny I'm doing Johnny Ives voice like it's still him but it's not even it's just gonna be like an executive on stage like so now you can use one charger for your iPad your MacBook and your phone how incredible is that they're also we're gonna give you a special a special brick where you can plug in two USBC things at once yeah it's gonna be great there are rumors that the new Air the airpods pro which are still the two or they're just gonna add USBC to that too they should just keep it lighting just to mess with us and airpods Max are also like they would have to update which it is around time for them to update the airpods max so if they if they do release airpod Max 2 with USBC that would be nice that would be insane to do all those things as USB and then still ship a lightning iPhone that seems insane that would be so funny but doesn't the cheapest iPad come with lightning it does still have lightning yeah oh the like super and so and so the cheapest but the cheapest iPhone can still be the s C yeah that's true maybe that's that's true no uh also there is a rumor that the next Apple watch uh it didn't say specifically whether it was the ultra which is apparently getting an Ultra 2 this year nice um which the ultra 2 is apparently going to be coming in matte black uh was that real or was it I saw like a render that's easily the most exciting thing it's a rumor it's a rumor yeah yeah I think um I saw a concept of it but basically every single year they use what is effectively the same chipset in the Apple watch like they update they update it very very slightly every year but it is almost not different at all but there's a rumor that apparently this year it's going to be significantly faster which is like cool it's nice yeah man Snoopy's gonna run great on it yeah I mean we have they changed the UI too with watch OS and now there's a bunch of widgets maybe they want to sort of like push this big update to the watch sort of shake things up a little bit with the watch if it's a significant node size change then maybe battery life will be improved that would be nice that would be really nice yeah okay so yeah that's kind of the Apple rumors uh we got a month until that happens like Apple watch is the craziest thing we've said this podcast matte black because I know we've had a matte black watch but it's like midnight so it's not really black oh that's a good point so like actually what if it winds up being midnight I would be so mad Matt midnight would you rather midnight or the silver that you have I like the silver I love it I love how good that looks honestly I'd say silver but it's not black matte black oh of course yeah yeah please please if that's not if that's not finalized yet someone at Apple can you just press that button lock that in please hey thanks for watching this clip um I think we should end this this outro with just uh rumors and speculation about the next episode of waveform what do you think what's going on Siri are you gonna be in the next podcast episode I heard confirmed confirmed next episode is over an hour long confirmed that's what I heard oh she agrees she agrees sorry agrees I heard it's gonna be slightly better bet she disagrees slightly better no shot she's like I don't think so I heard it's gonna have 700 000 views confirmed confirmed or is that just speculation uh as long as everyone likes and subscribes this clip it could happen so give her the mic give her the mic yeah oh she's scared of the mic oh my God don't scare her Ellis I'm sorry guys what the heck oh she's back scaring a dog what do you push over old people too like And subscribe laughs

       " \"and the cable that comes in the Iphone pro box is not USB 3 people, as a rule, when Apple stays quiet or the mess gets worse or doesn't get better, nothing wants to save the environment, closes the doors, stops putting in a new cell phone every year, spending on  that 's it ladies and gentlemen that's it Junior on the net once again from Apple more iPhones launched iPhone 15 iPhone family the iPhone 15 family iPhone 15 Plus pro and promex a lot of disappointments in the air this time huh I was #disappointed is a new hashtag  a new hashtag then I'll tell you that many, in fact, the rumors ended, like, let's say, confirming that it's a sad thing, right, because deep down we're waiting for a little news, it got a lot right, right, it just brought more news So let's go guys, start the our video here before I cry like Pitanga, let's first recap the main thing about the iPhone 15 and 15 for tests that you haven't seen, in fact, you want to see our reaction live, there's Live here on the channel, you discovered our traditional Live But let's start with  the iPhones 15 and 15 Plus, which in my opinion were the biggest upgrade for those who don't want the pro line, I think there are very interesting improvements, very crazy because when you compare, for example, the 14 with the 14, it proves the families there, you see.  which has a much higher level now Or 15, for example, it brought the advantages of the 14 pro and some improvements, huh? Well then, let's start, first, we have daianemic Island, which was an exclusive feature of the own line, now it is present, but the  screen in general is the same as the 14 even it hasn't improved now when we talk about this little guy's camera the camera is considerably better huh the main camera because the ultrawide it hasn't changed anything the front camera no one mentioned it either So nothing has changed either but the main camera has improved and now we have that sensor which is very different, right?  48 Megapixels with some improvements including the 15 and 15 Plus has a 1.6 diaphragm which is where the flaw is not better FF 1.6 is even better than the pro than the pro is the pro 1.8 isolating that's all it's better right but  There are other things, the size of the pixels, the sensor is bigger, it's not as big as the Pro, but it's a considerable increase in the quality of the camera compared to the previous generation, it has a pixel of two micrometers, right, and a focal length of  26 MM So there really was, let's say an advance, the main camera really improved, right? in a little while I'm going to vent about this And then you have a zoom that is similar to the previous generation which was 3x But you can give two x now so it's an advantage because it uses a crop on the sensor which is larger, it has a  higher resolution while maintaining cool quality So the 14 pro has a lens, even this is the 14 pro, it has the 15, it doesn't have it and the no pro line is, historically, it doesn't even have a telephoto camera, so this is a great one  upgrade because you'll still be able to zoom in there without losing much quality, right? So I thought this was a cool upgrade for those who want the iPhone, not Pro, but just like I said, the ultrawide front camera hasn't changed anything compared to the previous generation.  the front one even missed it there The other Wide they the other Live I think they didn't even mention it they mentioned telephoto as if it were broken But anyway another thing about the iPhone not pro or 15 not pro is its chip which is the a16 Bionic which is the  from the 14 pro from last year, so we already know that they achieved it because then they dump stock of the types that are sitting there and recovery reuse almost all of it and the screen closes there, the camera has improved a little bit, that's what improved the chips they are  so evolved nowadays that I think this is not necessarily a point that will affect you know, you're going to buy Oh, I'm going to buy Geez Will he be, I think that's not the case, he won't be slow because of this, right? USB Type C connection finally Wow, old man, I can't believe it, happy to have finally changed and sad that the rumor confirmed that yes it would be capable, it wouldn't be completely possible, right? In a little while I'll vent about this too but we have the USB Type C connection Good news  is that it also works to transmit audio and video from the non-proi model. So we have it, right? Everything indicates that we have the displayport protocol, so you can connect the iPhone to the external monitor, if you want, to a cable TV or to glasses with a screen, which is also  what I have and what I wanted, right, that's it, the 15 or 15 Plus, they are essentially the same, apart from the screen size and the battery size, right, the battery wasn't disclosed either, right? 6.6.7 It's on the same resolution, everything  We don't mention the same as last year, but that's it, we don't have information about the RAM battery, which we 'll find out, we'll find out in the next few days, as the person can disassemble it, exactly now let's move on to the next ones that there was an increase in the 15's camera. in 15 Plus there was no increase in the camera of the 15, right, it ended up becoming excrement. It was the same thing, it's a good thing, starting from the beginning, it's the titanium body, right, that's the big difference, it's the first time they change the  material, right, aluminum, they used stainless steel over titanium and they spent a lot of time at the event talking about it, right, because titanium is more resistant, it's lighter, it also looks like it's going to be 19 grams lighter in relation to the  previous generation for a smartphone, it can be more than 10% of the weight, it depends on the device, right, and talking a lot about the process, how complicated it is to manufacture because it takes 14 steps to get there, the titanium is not easy for you, bro, you leave that shape  what you want and so on, so a little more challenging, it will look a bit brushed on the sides, right? It seems like it's a kind of finish with us, I thought it was good that it gets less fingerprint marks, so for those who use it without a case, it will be cleaner and it's also titanium, as if  It says that it's as if it were a five graduation and as if it were really as if it were steps. In other words, it's each like the 6.7000 series aluminum, there are also titanium graduations, you know, perhaps one of the biggest new features of the pro line is the new action button that  It's also the first time, I was going to say 15 iPhones, but in the middle, but since the iPhone is original, it's the first time that the mute lock goes away, it goes away, it's something that was there, I think it was the last thing I never had.  been changed, right, the screen has already changed its shape, the buttons have already changed their location, but not now, we have a button that they call the action button, which by default still performs the function of the mute lock, it is to leave the cell phone on  silent mode But you can customize And then there are several functions there is a flashlight mode You can open the camera you can open one immediately it starts recording audio anyway you can assign several actions so it calls the action button right because I think this is  a very welcome novelty and it 's a small detail but it's cool Remembering that it has a tactile response, right? tactical feedback like the old home button, right, refined, well, we have USB Type C here, in this case, it's a good USB, it's the SB3 with 10 gabits, but when it says it doesn't happen, right, Thunderbolt, but oh, this speed was mentioned when they said it.  They talked there about the chip, right? It's the A17 Pro, it's no longer majoric, they changed it, right? We don't understand very well, although if you get the NS, it's not Max. Is this the case? Will it stop being a Proia next year, only 17 years ago?  when it goes to the iPhone 16, don't show it, there will be one, if there is an iPhone Ultra, next year here I will say that there wasn't, right, there will be the 18 Ultra, but we have an evolution in lithography in the manufacturing process, we were finally there for the three nanometers, boy, there's a deal here, the technology part is really impressive, it's the number of transistors they're managing to place, it's more efficiency, it's a smaller physical size too, right, for the chip and in terms of improvements in CPU and GPU performance, we have 10% more CPU, keep it in the same core division, there are six hexacore cores, two high-performance cores, four other efficiency cores, now the GPU has one more core, yes, now we have six GPU cores, they wanted to make it very expensive with one  there was a 20% increase in performance, you know, 20% more performance and Ray tracing in some games they showed, I don't know which game will actually have Ray tracer, right, we know that's how it is, it already exists in the Snapdragon 8 G2, of which  But it's difficult to see this market because developers end up focusing on mass-market titles to run even on the Galaxy j4 and not that it will only run at the top of the line, they can't go over the ruler, you have to go Premium, it's not Ready, but let's see, let's see see the evolution there, little by little, it's happening, hitting the GPU key a lot, they showed several games, Resident Evil 4 will be released, the remake will also be released, an Assassin's Creed, even Wesker there now, thanks to this new chip, the a17 pro, we're waiting for  improvements in camera image processing computational photography in the result when we talk about the 15 pro we didn't have any difference in the camera hardware you take it and put a specification I found it bizarre, you know because I saw several websites saying that the set of cameras improved  in the fifteen compared to the 14 pro And then I put the canoes here the presentations Look at the 14 pro side by side 15 pro is the same main camera hasn't changed techniques we have the same set The Tele hasn't changed another Wide either  It hasn't changed, so maybe there's another little detail that we 're not getting here, it changed there, but in principle, according to Apple's own words, the cameras are the same as the 14 Pro, the 15 Pro, but in the 15 Pro Max, we have a difference in the phone, exactly you.  There's a telephoto lens, they say 5x, but in reality there's a 120 MM lens, right? And a difference is that 100% of the pixels have Focus pixels, in the case of Promex, it's Pro, they use 6%.  Pixel focuses that that PDAF that autofocus do is phase detection, right, so in the case of the pro, 6% of the pixels alone that autofocus is faster can deliver that focus faster than my friends, it's 12 megapixels f2.8 with these a periscope with  a stabilization too, you know, that combines the Shape sensor with several things, there is a stabilization 10 thousand adjustments per second So it is It is a sensor it is a combination of ohis with that side of the second generation already the sensor there what is the success with a business  3D there that can move both laterally 2D and 3D here like this and adjusts this, which is much better, right ?  the line of iPhones, right iPhone 5 and 15 pro too, so they have the second generation Ultra Wide bendy chip that allows you to find You know that thing when you go to look for an art tag or any device that uses this one now you must  call U2 which is second generation you have doubled the radius for you to find it, right? It has a greater range and more precision also in locating devices that travel when Marta is arriving She has to be very close even less than 10 m to find it now it has doubled  Still talking about resources, we have expanded coverage of the satellite service, you know, emergency messaging, also going to Spain now and Switzerland for now, nothing from Brazil and they announced a new feature that uses this network, right, service, which is assistance  on the road it stopped being just an emergency thing, it was something that saved videos, even at the beginning of the night they showed several lives saved because of this, which has now become a convenience, also in his sense, I'm on a road that doesn't show any signal It's a smartphone, there's no cell phone signal, there's no GSM, there's nothing, and then I need it, I had a technical problem in the car, for example, there was a dry out, anything you have to connect with someone, you're not, you're not running  risk to your life but you're in trouble And then you can trigger this too, right? Remembering that these services in these countries, right, they are offered, you have two years for free and then you start to pay, right? So it's still a very initial stage, right?  they are building this business Ah, other small news that also happened there, iCloud Plus, now we will have plans with more storage, right, before it stopped at two Tera, now it goes up to six Tera and 12 Tera, also a lot, so there are two more plans there and they also mentioned a certain moment there  that the airpodes will get a little case in the Airport 2nd generation with USB Type C for those who want to bury the Lightning like we buried in Live including hip Lightning died ah 2012 with the iPhone 5 right He was born lasted lasted what is 11 long years long years half of that  but that's ok because it's another product that was also buried in this Live, it was the iPhone mini, there was no longer an iPhone 14 mini but the 13 mini was still sold and now it's actually gone from Apple's line so the line starts with the 13 there you have it the 14 I don't understand why I have 13 and you will also be able to charge it using the cable, you can reverse charge the iPhone via USBC so it will also work using the SBC and good news about the prices here in Brazil on the internet.  We talk about disappointments, good news, the price didn't go up here in Brazil, on the contrary, it fell by almost 10% there, so it 's cheap, it's not cheap, it's expensive, but at least the price didn't increase, I'm not one to defend the prices of the time  from Brazil, I'm not going to defend it now, but it hasn't increased, right? We only had to kill one connector to make a sacrifice here at the connector, you know, I don't need to pay the MF for it anymore, anyway These are the prices there too here in Brazil, now the time has come  net of disappointments now now is what the color was called here it looks red here now let's unload this thing I don't even know where to start man because in fact watch Live the live reactions got curious and who knows maybe do it live, right?  We really talk live about the thing there, you're crazy, come on guys Ah, this first one that I'm going to talk about here now is an insult that was meant with a resident and I said, do you want to see what this is going to be like, only the pro will have a USB Type  In fact, they had the idea of \\u200b\\u200bputting a two-point-zero 480 MB USB connection on the iPhone, not for 2004, the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus have USB 2.0, how much did the sbtian come out? of money is not a lack of technology it is not a lack it is a lack of what two thousand So you have been there for 20 years you do not need to adopt when the business exits you do not have to adopt when the business exits But the following happens she missed the opportunity to place an SBC  cool on the 15 and put a super Ultra mega power on the 15 pro it's not that good either Wait, the sb3 on the 10 giga bit is cool I think it's enough for a Smartphone but I could have put a thunderbolt there I could have put it  a usb4 there which is already 40 gigabytes like the doctors etc but not the Plus it got USB 2.0 from the 2000s literally from the year 2000 with 480 MB of speed now it 's the equivalent of you putting a floppy disk driver to rent the files now for love  of a doubt William But this is a good one, it will clear up one doubt, this one, you haven't seen it yet, you're going to hear it now, I'm going to give you a hook, so you go there, when I saw this, I said, it's not possible, but at least the rumors are there.  come some new cables some cool colored cable at least the cable besides being braided color that was not mentioned at the event that will be in the box at least the cable is 3.0 will it come with the cable or not it does not come with a colored cable the cable  it's braided, at least it doesn't have this one with a colored cable or this one that Majin Boo made the mistake of seeing here from the back, it follows the cable that comes in the Iphone pro box, it's not USB 3, it's not an SBT, did you see this because the guy says it there when he  It's showing that you can reach these speeds with 10 gabits with an optional USB3 cable, in other words, what comes in the box, it's not the S3, it's an SB2, just for charging, it's not for peace of mind, you know, in other words, it's very expensive to put in a three cable, you know, it's going to increase too much, man.  I'm going to tell you this is how we save the planet, 2030 is here, let's move on, so another disappointment, the second disappointment, the 60 screen on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus We still don't have a 120 hz screen and this one, I think in this category of price the iPhone It is the only smartphone that does not have a screen exactly if you consider its price in all other smartphones on the market it has a screen with more than 60 hz I know that I know people who watched it on Live Say oh but you had it  There's a class there that you even justify, we didn't defend it, no, he said that this is indefensible, there are users who don't even notice, most people don't notice the difference, it's that person who isn't connected to technology, that's exactly Apple's strategy.  Not everyone is a scrom sommelier, you know what we're just trying to do is not defend, explain what the strategy is, they put it there, most people don't care, they keep buying, so they keep money, that's it out of 10 that sold one complained, nine didn't say anything Follow  the boat understood Follow the boat now let's go the front camera is no better That was a disappointment also the iPhone breaking you know it wasn't or didn't even appear there another random moment but didn't say it appeared Maybe a selfie but not like that the person doing it or bringing specifications and people, as a rule, when Apple stays quiet or the mess has gotten worse or hasn't improved at all, it still doesn't talk now about the cameras. For this story about the iPhone 15, pay attention, see what is written there, twice a telephoto, photographers, what does this mean a lens that gives you twice the zoom optics? true, they pull out a little specification and it looks like what this is, you have a double zoom you have a camera up there but no, that's marketing, that's marketing, that's that crop of the sensor that I said that brings something equivalent through software to a great one but it is not clear that then it is a disappointment that continues, you know and on the website there in the details it presses here on my screen you will not put it for you now here when you enter it says a main camera of  48 a 12 ultra wide and it's as if it were another lens here on the iPhone 15 that doesn't have this other lens Look there 2x telephotos there it is here it's as if it were a camera it's as if it were a camera but it doesn't exist it's enabled, right?  Because of the Quad Pixel, the Quad Pixel sensor And then I said with an aperture of 1.6 which is the main aperture, you know that it bugged even the duty, right, the duty had the morality to do it there in the live blanket they put the iPhone 15, it has two cameras, one  main and a skin and no it has the ultrawide I turned green with embarrassment Yeah, right, so imagine if we want it to be more in this middle, fall for it So this is a joke I don't think it's bad, it's this two zoom  times but it shouldn't be called this time it's just a big disappointment for me. They continue with this misleading marketing, that for me is the equivalent of those Chinese brands that put a few extra holes in the cell phone and said it has more camera, it's crazy but Anyway, so it's another Wide and one with zoom, okay, so that's it, it's not with zoom, it confuses me again, it's another Wide, a main one that has double zoom, I'm in doubt, there's a time when they show 0.5 there.  or an a thousand likes I ask you is it not the equivalent of you in this logic is it not the equivalent of you having 50 it is also just for you to create other intervals there in the middle of zoom and one more disappointment is that we do not have fast loading at least nothing was said about  charging, the only information on the website is 50% charge in 30 minutes and the Safe charging also didn't change the ti charging didn't change that nonsense either 7.4 will continue to work the normal mega Safe and the ti two and the two tchu is great already  It's the new certification, it's the standard, that's it, right? We don't know, we know that the 14 pro, although they say the lowest number, I've seen it reaching almost 30 at the time you're monitoring the load, 27 28, but it could have  an option, right, for faster charging for everyone and the last disappointment here on our list is that there is no action button on the iPhone, what would it cost to put it, oh my goodness, wow, I'm going to have Earth here, the question is, people, they don't  go, all the line that it is, don't pro, do n't count on anything new, don't count I thought it was really cool that the guys put in a better camera like this, I thought it was super interesting but you can see that it doesn't have the other processor  It doesn't have these things, it pulls things from the pro, I even thought it was great to have a good camera, I actually did because here's the thing, Apple will always make you want to buy the most expensive one because it's the ticket, but it's so valuable, it's so much that if you get the Apple's market share and see which product it sells the most, Promex, you know, that's what kind of disappointment is optional here, right? Let's put it here, I don't think I needed to spend so much time talking about green initiatives, right? No, I'm not against but you don't need to rub it in my face because you are, it's cool that you mention, for example, at the end, say the following, this product is, it uses the crazy example well, but it spends more than half of the presentation of a product that was the case of hate, let  I'll talk about it in another video here later, come on, mother nature, I thought they were going to take out guns that were smaller than the size of the box, I thought there wasn't anything left in the box, you're crazy, you want to save the environment, close the doors, stop putting in a cell phone  new every year spend on this with people not buying cell phones say people don't buy it enough we will understand an iPhone that will last five years and then we will help the environment we will not produce this rubbish you are helping the  environment, sign, we know that I'm here, old man, I'm making a beautiful video, so if I wasn't here on this channel, I didn't even have a cell phone, it's crazy, that's a lie, so that's it, let's vent. And then you agree with this show, here, these vents, firstly,  that changed the news with lots of quotation marks, bringing information to you and then also expressing our indignation that there are things that can't be like this, you can't let it stop like this but we're still going to talk about ours but you're making a fool of yourself you're a Fanboy you  It's a boy Hey, you spent a long time saying this for the love of God, you're licking Live, it's blocked, Live is blocked, people, that's it, if you liked this video, leave your like and share it with the people, write down what your disappointments were for who  you liked it too and stay tuned because with the support of our dear sponsors ah nomad for me and Gol em porta this we will have some really cool coverage and we will bring you all the details if you have any questions about the smartphone do you want us to get down to something  something comment below, more than international coverage, it will be in more than one country to cover the four iPhone models. To cover, it's Ultra two nightclub and finally more of International but what more than international Global Thanks guys, see you next time\",\n",
       " \"we just got all four iPhone 15 models in the studio so let's take a look at all the main changes but first a quick word from Spigen our sponsor spigen's new range of cases for the new iPhone 15 Pros it gives you the edge in protection style and convenience check out Spigen by using the link below as well as later in the video and now back to the video let's take a look at what's changed in terms of the boxes first so compared to the 14s the 15s have a different wallpaper which actually matches the color of the phone so if you have a green phone this is how the box would look like same goes for the Pro Models the wallpaper matches the color of the phone and we do get a different wallpaper compared to the standard 15s when it comes to the unboxing experience it's basically the same as before the only difference being the braided USBC cable now and just holding both the 15 Pro and the old 14 for my hands I gotta say the 15 Pro feels awesome like it's hard to compare it feels so much more comfortable because of the rounded edges and I love the titanium finish it's not as fingerprint so you hope you can see that as the the 14 Pro and it just feels so much better so much more comfortable and it even feels more premium than the l14 pro and there's also a big difference when it comes to the 15 Pro Max this feels so much better way more comfortable in the hand and this just feels so sharp of the old working Pro Max and I'm excited I'm honestly excited to start using the 15 Pro Max as my main phone for uh well essentially the next year this is a major upgrade in comfort and feel yeah compared to the old 14 pro Max oh and I gotta say I'm actually very impressed with how thin the bezels are just take a look at that 15 Pro versus 14 pro the difference is definitely there absolutely love the way the 15 Pro looks even from the front oh and one more thing there's a substantial weight difference between the 14 pro Max and the 15 Pro Max like literally this is very very significant so if you're coming from a 14 pro Max or anything below that including the 12 Pro Max then you'll definitely love the 15 Pro Max quite a lot now when it comes to the new colors one of them is this blue titanium which I actually looks quite similar to the purple iPhone 14 pro at least to my eyes and very different to the Pacific Blue on the iPhone 12 Pro which was much lighter so this is considerably darker and also the camera Rings since they're now mad they now match the color of the phone a bit better than before when they were glossy and then the second new Pro color is natural titanium which looks awesome like this is I haven't seen the space gray just yet but so far this is my favorite color of the year it looks amazing uh and the fact that it's all matte on both the sides and the back I just love that oh and if you're looking for a cool new wallpaper for your beautiful device check out our new app wallpapers you can download it for free on both IOS and Android and to celebrate our launch we're giving away an iPhone 15 and an iPhone 15 Pro here's how you can enter now in terms of standard models we get some more pastel colors this is the green which I think looks quite nice but my favorite one is by far the new matte black iPhone 15 which has both matte black sides and a frosted glass matte black back now this is how it Compares against the space gray iPhone 14 pro so the 15 is actually a bit darker which I do really like and this is how it Compares against Apple's previous fully matte black iPhone the iPhone 7 plus now as you can see the 7 plus was a tiny bit darker now Apple has also updated their case lineup this year with the new fine open material that replaces the old letter cases okay so um this is very weird I've just tried it for a bit and I you know I just don't like the feel of it it feels it feels like very very low end clothes no wait I don't know really really what you're feeling I'm honestly not a fan now the buttons are still made out of metal which is nice but the side is actually made out of um silicon whereas the back is of course made out of this fine woven material so you get different materials rather than this continuous design that we had on leather cases and like I said this material just feels really really weird and I'm I'm generally not a fan oh and by the way I've just noticed that if you scratch it um you can easily scratch it permanently so that's not great your ability is just not great on this case oh and speaking of iPhone cases spigen's iPhone 15 Pro case lineup offers style and protection while featuring their Mac Fit design for macsafe the ultra hybrid Mac Fit is made to last with drug clear attack ensuring that it doesn't yellow over time like other cases do their new Ultra hybrid macfit s also offers a kickstand useful for hands-free viewing and their new Ultra hybrid colors look great too I absolutely love this stealthy Frost black the Mac armor macfit has an updated Chevron design which emphasizes a more modern approach of subtle contrast which changes its look based on the angle that the light hits it from which I especially love on their navy blue the popular teardown zero one design now returns showing your phone's internals and a new White Edition arrives in late September plus each Mac Fit has been enhanced to be stronger than before so your max of accessories work even better check out Spigen by using the links below okay so now let's talk about the cameras there are pretty much two big upgrades this year the switch from smart hdr4 to Smart hdr5 which should improve hdr photos and then the 5x Zoom module on the iPhone 15 Pro Max compared to the 3x on the 15 Pro and the 14 pro if we take a look at his first image here the HR processing looks almost identical until you zoom into the clouds where you can see that the 15 pro has indeed exposed them better same applies to the second photo right here where the 14 pro just blows out the sky completely whereas the 15 Pro manages to expose it much better so smart hr5 doesn't need seem to fix the blown out highlights issue at least for the overcast days like this one when it comes to the ultroid there are no major changes here although the 15 Pro does have a slightly Brighter Image portrait mode trots were a bit strange as I do think the 14 pro did a better job here with more contrast and a Sharper Image especially if you take a look at my hair so now let's compare the zooms if you take a look at the lenses you can actually see the difference between the 15 Pro and the 50 team pro Max and if we take a look at a sample to be honest the difference isn't that big if we take a look at a tree they look almost the same especially zoomed out now when you zoom in you can see that the 15 Pro Max manages to show this sign much clearer than the 15 Pro but yeah I wouldn't really say that difference at least at five axis that much between the two now if we go up to 10x and compared to 15 Pro Max to the s23 ultra the s23 ultra is better it's got a cleaner image it looks higher resolution and that makes sense as the s93 ultra does have a 10x optical zoom lens compared to the 5x on the 15 Pro Max and if we Zoom all the way to 25x which is the highest on the 15 Pro Max the s23 ultra is significantly sharper and more detailed at the same zoom level of course on the s13 ultra you can zoom in even further up to 100x so yeah pretty much like I expected the 15 Pro Max has a decent Zoom but still it cannot compete with the s23 ultra now interested in the low light performance since the 15 Pros have the same sensor as the 14 Pros there is isn't really much difference in fact in the second shot the 15 Pro Max was worse than importing from Ax if you take a look at this plant right here now the 15 Pros do have a new lens coating that reduces Reflections and it does seem to work really well but other than that the improvements just aren't that big now we will be doing a detailed camera comparison against different devices so do stay tuned for that okay now another big change is uh the change from the traditional mute switch that we've had ever since the first iPhone to the brand new action button so the way the action button works is that if you press it uh once it just shows you what the action button will do when you hold it so you always have to hold it to enable that function and by default it just switches between silent and ring mode and then if you go into settings and then action button you get this really really nice menu and you can customize uh what the whole gesture does and for example for the camera you can switch between taking a photo or even a video so that it automatically takes you to taking a video so if we set it to the camera now if you hold it it will launch the camera if you press it once it will the photo you also have the option for the flash for The Voice Memos for the magnifier and even for a Siri shortcut in case you want to customize it to do basically anything accessibilities and then if you want to keep it as I don't want inactive button wherever it would even do that and you also have that option I mean in my case I'm definitely going to use it to uh launch the camera Hello Connor but really one of the biggest changes for most people is the switch from lightning to USB type c so if I simply plug in a USB type-c cable you can see that it charges both the 15 Pro and the same applies to the regular iPhone 15. now what's really cool about the iPhone 15 Pro Models this year is that thanks to the Apple a17 Pro chip they'll be able to play Triple A console quality games like Assassin's Creed Mirage Resident Evil 4 Resident Evil Village and death stranding but none of these are actually out just yet they'll be coming later in the year so in conclusion based on my literally first impressions of the iPhones um I'm quite happy with the iPhone 5 team line like there are a lot of improvements that I've made especially on the standard iPhone 15s I love the frosted glass bag the matte finish looks awesome and the 15 Pros look awesome as well I love the new colors but I was just hoping for I don't know a bigger camera jump like I was hoping for some some bigger upgrades of course we'll be doing an in-depth camera comparison soon against different phones so we'll test that there I'm also curious to test the battery life and I don't know I do hope that it gives us more options for the action button because I think it has a lot of potential but yeah let us know what what you guys think um don't forget about wallpapers it's free to download and let us know what you think we'll be improving it every single week uh thanks for your feedback I'm Daniel this means of tech and yeah stay tuned for the next upcoming iPhone 15 videos so I think signing out cheers [Music] oh\",\n",
       " \"[music] I'm leaving the Apple Store and continuing to shoot a video on the iPhone 15 Pro Max [music] Hello everyone This is the first look at the iPhone 15 Pro Max, this is the most beautiful titanium By the way, this video was completely shot on another iPhone 15 Pro Max in blue color, it's there  in this video, we will compare it with the iPhone 14 Pro Max in terms of impressions, according to some characteristics, I will tell you how they differ, I will tell you about the first impressions of the new product, and thus we will start the iPhone marathon as part of the iPhone marathon this year, we will have a lot and then we will finish it with a full  review, but also Well, that's not all. I bought a few from these fainovens. I will use a few of them and one especially for a crash test, so if you want to see how we will practically spoil this new material as much as possible, which of it must be subscribed, click likes and we're going  to test our iPhone 15 Pro Max and share my first impressions, I always take fir colors, I don't know why, I don't even like purple, but it's branded. I bought it this year, it was a dilemma to buy blue because it's blue. I like it, and it was last worn in 12 about maxire, by the way, was the titanium one cool? I think you know which one I chose because I'm showing it to you right now. I actually really like the titanium one, but we also have blue ones for this review. I'll show you the first impression you get after you  go to 14 about Max to 15 about Max, you think the differences will be the same that it is still lighter, it is lighter by almost 20 g, it is 240 and 221 if I am not mistaken and this difference in weight is felt, it also affects the fact that the iPhone has become more with rounded edges, if they hit the hand like this, I've been saying this since the 12th generation, then here it is more pleasant in the hand - you can immediately feel it. Well, I love Titanium very much. I said this even last year, if Apple makes a titanium case, then it's possible  don't update anything, I'll buy it anyway, it's just some kind of internal fetish, I didn't buy a titanium bike until I couldn't calm down, now I have it Now the iPhone is also titanium, well, that's why it's in neurol titanium colors, the second thing you immediately notice is the frame  because the frames in the iPhone 15 Pro Max have become smaller, while the screen is flat, it's cool And you know, it feels like a completely new phone because you're holding something new in your hands. It's lighter, but at the same time not very light, I was worried that it wouldn't feel like that you know  like plastic, no, and at the same time, your frames are thin, but at first glance there are no accidental touches at all, that is, now I picked up the phone in such a way that it is unnatural to go around the phone and you can see that nothing interferes with scrolling on the display. Now we will continue to look at the iPhone 15 promax, but first a small one  integration from our friends, thanks to whom this video is possible, I want to remind you that you can buy a used iPhone, but in a good condition, you can buy it from our partners in the store Apple Big mac.ua, because at first, new iPhones of the 15th series will be very expensive, and now is the time to turn  pay attention to such as 14 iPhone, and a little later you will be able to buy used and 15 series from them, buying second-hand equipment is always a risk, because you can easily get caught and run for money, and in the case of the iPhone, not even a small amount of money, mac store  .ua has been operating for 9 years on the Ukrainian market and has 50,000 customers, the main thing is that they sell at the prices of bulletin boards, but here you will also get a one-month warranty and a complete set. bags, even if the device stops working, they will chip it or replace it for you, because every iPhone they have undergoes a thorough inspection so that you get exactly what you expect. There are no broken devices or devices with non-working functions on sale here, so there is free delivery in Ukraine, so that used Apple equipment  you need to buy bigmak, follow the link in the description and you will receive an additional promo code of UAH 500 for a discount on your purchase in the store and we will continue And here I will tell you why I buy myself a new iPhone every year Well, of course, besides the fact that I am a blogger, this is my job  this is how I make money here with us, people are interested in viewings, and that is why I shoot an iPhone marathon in September every year, only this year I came up with the name. By the way, thanks to the subscribers for this, the point is that for me these are actually tools and I counted how much for me in total  made iPhone 14 Pro Max And before it 13 Pro Max how much money did we raise for the Armed Forces, we bought more than 70 pickups shooting all the content on the iPhone We shot all of them for sure 100% of the video on Cedar holes using the iPhone 13 Pro shares 14 about Max I went to shoot an awesome report  about Porsche using my iPhone, I didn’t even take the extra sound. I shot a bunch of commercial projects, almost all of them are for Reviews, the tastes are daring on the iPhone, almost all of the extreme videos were shot on the iPhone, including trips, and I stopped taking the camera with me, so for me, this is a professional tool and  as I said, it brings money, it is important because yes, the iPhone is an expensive smartphone, but when it is reflected, when it really works, I believe that it is necessary to update together, and this year Apple added everything that I have been asking them for for several years, you can take a look  a video about the biggest disadvantages of my iPhones about what I expect And in one generation they took and added everything I asked to be able to start the camera from a locked state with some mechanical key I didn't think it would be action-batting I'm already shooting this review I  I understand how convenient this slipper is, you will ask why Sanya it is necessary If you could just touch or press a button and swipe The fact is that in the winter when I am filming there on a bicycle or something else you are wearing gloves it is difficult to do this it is in principle difficult to interact with sensors when you are on the move and here you have a mechanical key with which you can do many things, in my case the most important thing is the camera As you can see, there was no action key in the menu before, now this item is there and you can configure what you want to be done here yes no  that is, to turn off accessibility, there is a command, that is, you can actually hang anything here, you can do any script, it’s cool, a magnifying glass, a voice note for those who write down a lot of text in order to remember it later, it will be relevant, a flashlight is also a good topic, well, for  I have a camera, and here you can also choose what you will configure specifically, what you will use when you turn on the camera with this key, you can take a selfie, photo or video for me, a direct video is what you need, and now look, the smartphone is locked, I press it and automatically we have  the second video starts - it's typecast and I didn't have anything against lighting from the very beginning. I really like lighting mechanically, but USB 2.0 Considering that now you can write 4K 60 even in the usual format, they weigh a lot. I bring 200 GB of material there with every trip.  it's hard to throw a slipper and considering that they added a slot last year Well you understand it just as a joke sounds now you can use type-c version 3.2 Jet 2 to download your files directly to a computer or SSD with a speed of 10 GB or even write  in the slot in the vine directly on the SSD from the smartphone, well, it’s real Cosmo And also Unlike the previous iPhone, you can charge airpods, Apple Watch, even some Android smartphones If you have a type-c Thai wire, you can say that it’s Revolution Johnny, because the iPhone So earlier  they didn't know how, but we know that Android smartphones aren't what they've been able to do for a long time, they also have reversible charging, and I think that Apple could add the next intervishlist here.  so that they stick together and charge, it’s on the surface. Well, there’s a little thing that few people will understand, I’ve already said about it, it’s a titanium case, but I just really wanted it, but of course I would have bought an iPhone without it. It’s interesting that the frames that have become smaller  the dimensions of the device were also affected, it is a little thicker, but at the same time it is almost a millimeter smaller. From each side, this means that if we take a leather one from 14 promax, the new one just flies into it like that, and if you turn it over, in principle, you can easily get it. Well, it is almost straight  it falls out, but you can really use it, if you put a little double-sided tape on it, then, in principle, leather cases still exist. Here's a life hack. By the way, even the camera works fine. It really fits. There is a button. Well, the only thing is that this action button will have to be climbed in there with a fingernail, but it's okay.  well, they are ready to suffer a little for a leather case. By the way, the difference between these smartphones is not only in the material and a little in the dimensions, because the design of the case has also changed for the better, it has become more repairable. Maybe you have already seen it at the presentation, maybe not, but even Apple has already evaluated the replacement rear glass for $200.  it's still not much, but before replacing the rear glass for 14 cost 550 dollars, that is, the difference is 350 bucks, that's a lot of money. Why is that? Because before you couldn't remove the back cover separately, you had to change the entire body, and it's actually a problem even to replace the battery in it is much easier for the new generation to do it, and for most people who are not interested in all this, the most important thing that has changed is the camera about the camera. We will make a separate video with a comparison, but here it is important to say that of course the wide-angle module and ultra-wide remained almost the same, if something changed there, it was very not much sooner than all this will be related to the process itself, but the TV in the promax version has become completely different, it is not periscopic as many people said it would be. And when I saw at the presentation that it was round, I thought Well, here we don't get enlarged  But they got the zoom because Apple made a prismatic system. As far as I know, no one before them did this, and it allowed to increase the beam that falls on the matrix several times, now here we have a 5X optical zoom, and at the same time, this seems to me to be a bit of a genius solution, why first of all  your matrix is \\u200b\\u200bnot as small as in other smartphones with a periscopic system, and secondly, the aperture hole here can be quite large. And if I am not mistaken, this is the largest aperture among all smartphones with a five-fold optical zoom f-2 and eight, as well as in all  new iPhones of the 15th series by default, you will receive photos in 24 megapixels, this is actually also cool because today I have many smartphones there are 100 megapixels, 108 there are 200 megapixels, but at the same time they all combine pixels and you will receive 12 megapixels by default. If you decide increase the number of megapixels, because you can get even 200 megapixels from Samsung, then you will not be able to take photos very quickly, because each photo will be processed, now you have the opportunity to take photos by default at 24 MP, and it happens so quickly, that is, you can click click and it  takes pictures, and you can also take photos in 48 MP, not in Rav. Previously, in order to use the entire 48 MP matrix, you had to turn it on once. As you can see, now you can write the vlog slot and you can turn the slot on and off, and the most important thing is that you immediately have the opportunity to write to usbc, you connect external  the drive is automatically recognized and you write directly to it, this is just some space after that. Enter the file, our ssdshnik, find the D7 folder, here it is a folder created by Apple and your few seconds about the RES, look in comparison, what I noticed And this is awesome, you can on 15 promax switch directly during shooting in 4K 60 between all cameras from 0.5 to 5X and there is no interpolation, the modules are switched on the 14 Pro Max, you could do it using interpolation, that is, the modules do not switch, and it is basically impossible to include 0.5 on the new iPhone, everything  it can be done and it’s a Fiat, that is, you can write in 4K 60 on all modules and even on the front panel. By the way, this is a cool thing, because as far as I know, no Android smartphone today allows shooting 4K 60 on all its cameras. Maybe I don’t have 23 ultra  I'm sure it's still simple and eights, but here you can actually shoot in the same quality in order to record a vlog on all cameras, including the front camera. Also, the Wi-Fi has changed in the new iPhone, now it's not just Wi-Fi 6A 6i. By the way, this means that even  with routers that do not support wi-fi 6 and the speed of downloads and data transmission will no longer be I don't know why it works like this everyone says about it for some reason And because it affects the control of smart gadgets, the naming of processors has also changed If before all our processes were bionics including a-16 byok So now it's about the A 17 Pro, it's three nanometer - it's the first three-nanometer processor on the market, if I'm not mistaken, and Apple took 80% of all production capacity with those smc. So everyone else is forced to stand in line or use some other companies manufacturers of processors, I will not say that it is numerically very much ahead of the previous bionic plan, even at the presentation they said that the difference was 10%, in fact, they slightly underestimated these data, because in some modes the advance is more, but the main thing is that the GPU here has become completely different and now there is hardware repression Now  you will be able to play even some Triple a games and this is the first time in history when Triple a games new for consoles are released also on a smartphone on the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Max you will be able to play them for example detrending reading Evil Mirage i4 or even the new Assassin's Creed that will be released  next year, and other games will be released already this year, this means that you will be able to play on these small things like on a console, modern patient projects, connect a Gamepad here, connect all this to the screen and play and someone will say Sanya, you can buy a console for 500 bucks and play in a bigger one the number of games This is true, but the fact is that the same can be said, and what other camera can you buy for one and a half thousand bucks that will shoot in a slit, wet, on the attack, the number of focal lengths and this smartphone really allows you to shoot videos about resology using external SSDs, this is really  very cool, we remember that this is a really expensive thing, it is still a smartphone and it allows you to do a lot of things and work with videos, music, texts, etc. better, but all together in such a compact case, you are unlikely to find a new one about the prices. It costs a little more than last year, but the memory option is now the basic one, not 128 GB, but 256, and if you count like that, the 256 GB version costs the same that's all. Last year in Europe it was €1,500, and in Ukraine, the official ones will cost UAH 63,500 for the basic version. As always, you can see all prices on the e-catalogue, the link in the description of this video, so friends, this is the first look, I'm actually very glad that  got a new smartphone, then we will have videos with tests of this case, there will be a comparison of the camera Where we will compare it in detail with the iPhone 14 Pro Max and I will tell you whether it is worth updating for the sake of the cameras and many other things at the end, of course we will come to a full review Thank you for that  who watched this video. Don't forget your likes and comments for everyone\",\n",
       " \"finally got the new iPhones iPhone 15 iPhone 15 plus iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now the color selection I have in here it was deliberate not necessarily my first choices but ones that I thought would be good to take a look at and compare first up we had to get one in the natural titanium this is a 15 Pro and natural titanium and it's actually a one terabyte version which is complete Overkill if you saw my how not to order an iPhone 15 video I think for most people one terabyte is kind of uh probably diminishing returns when you consider the cost but this was the only natural titanium I could get when I ordered it and I definitely wanted to show off a natural titanium so that's the spec on that one and by the way these like last I checked delivery times had slipped into October and for the pro Mac natural titanium into November so apparently this is a very hot color that people are interested in next up for the regular iPhone 15. now you guys remember from my how not to order the iPhone 15 video I said that for the standard 15 Baseline model I would personally be interested in the blue so that's what we have here they just call it blue it's like that very very light blue color so we'll check that out we've also got a yellow I was the most skeptical of I said I would not order the yellow for myself personally but because of that I wanted to get one for this unboxing video to see does it truly look as bad as I think it might I mean it is the palest Demis yellow that I don't even and then last is another interesting color the blue titanium a new color which kind of looked like the darker titanium colors in general like this one has a little bit of a blue tone to it so it could be interesting that gives us one of each model 15 Pro 15 regular 15 plus and of course 15 Pro Max unboxing experience similar these things have just continued to get more and more slender there's less and less inside the package and that's not exclusive to Apple that's for all smartphone brands that have now stopped including a ton of extras two little pull tabs this is extremely frustration free no blade even necessary here's our first Glimpse at the natural titanium okay for sure this phone got lighter I can just tell I handled this device often enough to know that you know it feels lighter in the hand we have the brushed titanium look it's already Gathering some fingerprints there apparently this is more of an issue on the darker colors we'll do our testing over there as well but yeah you're gonna tarnish it a little bit it's titanium hopefully Mo can pick that up there it does gather fingerprints immediately on the titanium frame but titanium is such a cool material when they say natural titanium it kind of messed with your mind a little bit or at least it did for me because sometimes I'm ordering clothes like a natural hoodie or something and it actually has like a beige tone to it when you think of natural but they're just meaning here like this is the color of titanium it looks like a brushed kind of Steel color so camera module cut out power switch over here volume up and down and then obviously the new action button look at this this is so strange to see on an iPhone for the first time USBC on the bottom of the device no more lightning connector we've also got speakers in that location as well inside the package not a ton I think we're going to get some stickers a white Apple sticker not a natural titanium sticker a Sim tool a little bit more paperwork and then a braided USBC to C cable it's white it's not any type of like special color to go with the natural titanium no more power adapter included in the box and you might be thinking about what your options are for that our partners at anchor have plenty of solutions for you including this little guy this is a 20 watt power brick which is the same size as Apple's existing 5 watt power brick look at this they're I mean basically the same size either is pocketable and one is 20 and the other is five now Apple also sells their very own 20 watt adapter but that gets quite a bit larger and actually more expensive than anker's variant but Anker has a bunch of other products too including their very own high powered type c cables to match the aesthetic and then there's some new power Banks they just put out also this nano power bank is capable of 30 watt recharge I like the fact that you can kind of hang this one you've also got a USB a and another USBC there's another little power bank option here which plugs in just like this sits on the bottom 22.5 watt capable nano power bank USBC connection for iPhone now and not just Android devices you can use this for all your different devices including your other iOS devices that were already on USBC now what about when you're at home or traveling maybe on the desktop or even on the bedside table check out how slim this little power cable is power strip they've actually designed it so that the receptacle extends to receive the entirety of the power brick USBC USB a another usba and then one more type c so lots of Versatility here this is called the six in One charging station and it's 67 watt capable now I know most people have moved on from this 5 watt brick but there's still out there I still see people recharging their modern smartphone with a USB a 5 watt Apple power brake believe it or not if you are committed to this form factor and you want something extremely small then that's where the Nano Pro comes in you can have that but still get the 20 watts that your device can take advantage of so what we'll do is unbox two of these phones we'll plug one into the 5 watt adapter and one into the 20 watt adapter just to Showcase how big of a difference that is you can go check the description for pricing you're also going to save money on this right now to go with your new iPhone so go click those links and pick up a nano Pro from Anker for faster charging in a similar little form factor all right next up let's reach for the iPhone 15 blue and this is actually the base model and so therefore it is the most affordable iPhone 15 at the moment I'm having a hard time figuring out what to recommend to people I was actually just having a conversation with the viewer of the channel randomly in public that's even lighter than I thought it was going to be and he said what should I get should I get the iPhone 15 what do you think do I need the pro and then he was going over his finances with me and I was like well hard to say these are all expensive of devices I think bang for your buck for somebody in that boat for somebody who is concerned about the upgrade costs coming from a much older iPhone very reluctant to upgrade probably the 15 is sufficient the other thing I should mention speaking of light weight these have gotten a lot closer now because of the titanium aspect the titanium construction on the pro model the blue is more prominent in the frame rather than the actual back plate really dims the bluishness and instead it almost looks white I don't mind it it's just extremely light keep that in mind so in the hand we're talking about an extremely comparable user experience we've got USBC joining the party on the standard iPhone 15 as well we've got a slightly different placement for the SIM tray we have our separate volume buttons and no action button instead you maintain your switch which I don't know for some people that might be a preference they may prefer the existing switch we've got our power switch over on the other side and the camera hump not as significant still got plenty of wobble there slightly less maybe do we have blue stickers nope just going to get a white sticker they simplified all right next up we have the controversial yellow I believe in my last iphone 15 video I think I referred to this as urine colored iPhone yellow I don't know gotta wait and see things can sometimes appear differently I wasn't the only one a lot of people were saying hey these colors are extremely subdued this year nothing is very vibrant kind of pale yeah hahaha that is a weird that is weird like how you have I don't know if this is showing up for you Mo but there's nothing pleasing about this color to me at all it's a barely there yellow a reasonably hydrated urine which increases in its Amber tone when you get to the camera I don't know who wants this color the frame I don't mind it's kind of more of like a light gold but like the actual phone itself that is a a rather odd Choice from Apple the same otherwise compared to the non-plus model we've still got our USBC here we've got our switch which remains intact obviously battery sizes display sizes are going to be different if you guys are curious about the e-sim thing here in Canada we're still having the SIM tray even though these devices are simultaneously esim compatible or capable however in some markets they could be esim only so this is the granddaddy the pro Max and this is in blue titanium and it is the base model 256 storage base for the Promax the base for the standard phone is 128. I think this is a beautiful color this is a very nice color this one is better in real life than in the images it is a very very deep blue almost towards black with the mirrored blue finish up in the camera section here and the matte finish everywhere else from a fingerprint perspective also a bit of a magnet because of that titanium aspect I don't know for me my initial reaction is so what it's titanium that's so cool like a titanium phone like just the attributes of titanium are so cool and lighter definitely which makes a bigger difference on a bigger phone you know if you were sort of borderline if you wanted a Max device now it's a little bit lighter it's a little bit less of a brick in my pocket pretty cool so check this out these are now set up and the first thing that you are prompted by on the pro and pro Max model is to configure your action button press and hold to turn silent mode on and off you can also customize the action button to open camera turn on flashlight or access a favorite iPhone feature okay so let me click customize we'll see what some of the options are silent mode yeah we know about that Focus so do not disturb that's nice straight into the camera flashlight voice memo magnifier a shortcut to an app for now for the purpose of demonstration we'll do flashlight here we go that's a that's an action button flashlight press and hold it's off press and hold it's on press and hold its off I can see this being useful I mean look I like buttons I like switches I like versatility I like the fact that it doesn't have to be something by default but instead it's encouraging you to configure it and they even built that little initial interface in order to encourage you to do so this display is bright that is a very nice looking display on the pro Max let's boost the brightness on the standard Pro also extremely bright let's do a quick display comparison while we're here yeah more pop on the pro have you not seen that yet what was it you haven't seen this yet no no you don't blow on it you just tap them like that to exchange contacts nearby share have you seen that before yeah it's subtle but this display is a slight step slight Step Above let's go to the regular 15. this display looks better than the regular Pro it looks better than the plus it looks better than the standard iPhone 15 subtle they all look good so let's test the speakers let's start with regular iPhone 15 audio test full volume [Music] foreign 15 plus [Music] iPhone 15. [Music] 15 plus [Music] the plus has more bass yeah let's go to the pro [Music] foreign [Music] I would say and then last up Pro Max which should sound the best [Music] [Music] take away here the bigger phones just sound better there's obviously subtle differences beyond that I don't know maybe maybe the 15 plus might sound the best but it's very similar they're close cameras okay let's bring over our favorite plant within the pro lineup the max model gives you the advantage of having more reach on the zoom lens what that means for you is five times Optical I'll go in order of short to Long here is 0.5 x followed by 1X which they're calling 24 millimeter 2x which they don't bother representing in millimeter form and then 5X damn that 5x is nice very beautiful bokeh like in the background so this is exclusive to the pro Max model if you really want that extra reach and this is where you're going to be looking if I load up the standard pro model the layout is identical except in this situation the furthest reaches 3x so 0.5 1 two and three so to get an idea of the difference in reach that's what 3x is going to give you that's what 5x is going to give you so quite different but I don't know at a sporting event or something you could take advantage of 5x a concert I don't need to tell you these these cameras are great performers and now we have this new 5x Zoom which is one of the better Optical zooms I've seen Now we move over to the standard iPhone 15. our options once again are different we go from 0.5 to 1 and then to 2X and we end there it's kind of funny you go up the the list here and you get closer and closer the more money you spend the closer you get to your subject standard model 0.5 one two they all look great we're talking about cameras on smartphones in 2023 they do all have Dynamic Island it's a tried and true form there's people watching this video that are sitting there saying it's not different enough I agree like it's there's nothing shocking about it it's iterative I said this in previous videos hey you put a little button over here you throw an action button on there you're changing material to Titanium how big of a deal is that to the general public most of the conversations I'm having in public it's not that big of a deal you asked Tim Cook he'll be telling you these are the best iPhones we've ever made as they should be they're the most recent version but how much better than the previous version for me this this is going to sound crazy but for me the most compelling new feature is USBC and that's kind of sad it just took too long oh but seriously like I just hated having to have separate cables even separate cables within Apple's ecosystem I was ready for that to be done and now that we have type c here this feels to me like a modern 2023 device the other thing I should mention one of my favorite aspects of iPhones in general is the video modes these are some of the best video Shooters out there period it has an incredibly smooth and pleasing smartphone video capability 4K here 4K 60. look at the bokeh look at the Focus fall off look at the 60 frames look at the smoothness and I'm gonna move around this plant look how smooth this camera move is and of course the audio that you're hearing is coming via the microphones on the device as well so you get a sense for the performance there and I will do my usual and approach Mo in an uncomfortable way so that you can see how it focuses on a human face but then I'll hold it longer than I should oh no so then he gets more uncomfortable and we get a we get the retention Spike that we're looking for okay the camera's really good look man like the camera is really good the camera's really good because I've been shooting videos for so long I had a video camera back in the day before anybody had video cameras like before smartphones even shot video think about that for a second couple of gray hairs in the beard over here the fact that we can shoot that caliber of video on this little guy is just a bit ridiculous honestly how different is it going to be if I'm saving some cash and grabbing the iPhone 15 regular 4K 60. iPhone 15 regular test smooth 1X audio coming through the microphone spin tomorrow is it 4K oh it's 4K okay okay that looks great as well man for for the average person it looks great as well this one's Gathering more fingerprints by the way as I'm using it you know what these fingerprints don't matter to me because I know I'm gonna slap a later case on here anyways just like that boom and just like that my titanium is mostly protected and covered and I'll just be holding on to this beautiful Kevlar instead without adding a tremendous amount of weight or bulk and yes we are taking orders for 15 pro pro Max 15 regular 15 plus so head over to the link in the description if you want to pick up a later case for yourself this is for people who want the absolute thinnest case possible extremely satisfying texture and extremely easy on and off capabilities satisfying in every way so how much are you really missing out on if you're still letting this live watt power adapter kick around well you're missing out on like over an hour's worth of savings recharging your device and we actually stacked the deck against anchors 20 watt in this case by having it recharge the bigger Pro Max model which obviously has a bigger battery to charge versus the 5 watt which only had to recharge the regular Pro 15 Pro so the pro Max charging off of the 20 watt nanopro power adapter that's two hours and 20 minutes from dead complete dead zero all the way to a hundred percent and the old school 5 watt power adapter took three hours and 40 minutes to charge up the iPhone 15 Pro from zero Dead all the way to full It's Time to Say Goodbye to these little units and replace them with far better units like the this one 20 watts versus 5 Watts it's an absolute no-brainer all right so there you have it iPhone 15 15 Pro 15 plus 15 Pro Max is it a revolutionary iPhone not really I told you my favorite feature is kind of a mundane one which is just USB type-c I like the material I like this idea of titanium I do like having this configurable action button I love the fact that Apple left it configurable I think my optimal device out of the bunch is probably the 15 Pro regular size I also think the 15 is probably a good value for a lot of people comparatively if you're in the Apple ecosystem if you're sticking with iPhone I don't think you have to have the pro model the standard model has gotten really good yes you're giving up some features and functionality but for a lot of people I talk to in public this thing is going to be a huge upgrade over what they currently have in their pocket the fit and finish is really nice it's well put together the colors leave something to be desired they're not super Punchy they're more subdued this year but who knows maybe some people will prefer that let me know down in the comments which model you're most interested in if you're gonna buy one at all or if there's some other smartphone that you have your eye on also make sure to go support our sponsors anchor and also of course later case if you want to slap an incredibly slim case on your brand new iPhone 15 15 Pro 15 Pro Max 15 plus or other smartphone thank you very much for your time foreign\"]"
