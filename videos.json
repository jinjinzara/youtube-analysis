		"captions": "should you get an iPhone 15 Pro Max or save $300 and get a 15 plus well I'm going to tell you guys every single difference skipping the specs but focusing on real world differences and this year the results are a lot different than last year and I think you guys are going to be surprised now I mentioned that price difference there and you have a difference of ram 256 versus 128 now most people don't need 256 so that's a 300 difference and I was surprised that the memory speed is not much slower even though it is half the capacity now as far as the comfort in hand last year I loved the 14 plus because it was so much lighter but this year the difference is very minimal and with that the 15 Pro Max is actually slightly narrower and slightly shorter than the 15 plus and because of the new curved edges on the front and the back both phones feel very comfortable and it's hard to tell that the 15 Pro Max is slightly thicker now we definitely have a difference in camera bums the 15 Pro Maxes sticks out quite a bit more so if you don't like Wobble the 15 plus is a little bit better in that way and one difference this year is that the new titanium no longer feels a lot more premium in the hand compared to the aluminum they actually feel almost identical now of course most people are going to be using a case so no matter which one you buy you should definitely get a reliable case like these from our sponsor casify who make the most protective cases out there like their impact case bounce case and their brand new Ultra bounce and impact ring stand cases their bestselling impact case is super slim and stylish offering drop protection of up to four times the military standard with their twister ecoshock in lining which you can now also get in the new ringstand variant with a built-in kickstand so you can prop it up for or watching videos if you want more protection the bounce case has up to six times military drop protection being 16% Slimmer than before and their newest Ultra bounce case takes it up to 10x the military standard with their revolutionary Ultra bounce corners and six layers of protection including the integrated camera lens cover to give you incredible draw protection all of them are made out of 65% recycled and plant-based materials featuring mag saafe and being available in a ton of customizable prints like this one which is my personal favorite because of the cool tear down design so check out one of kfi's new iPhone 15 cases by going to casey.com maxt and save 15% off your order today now the next Real World difference is the action button on the 15 plus you have that classic silent switch which is really nice but having this action button you can do a ton of things I have mine set to open up the camera app and that is very convenient but you can also use it for silent mode focus camera flashlight voice memos and of course shortcuts so you can customize this to whatever you want and how much does that matter in the real world well I think it is nice compared to just that silent rocker but I don't think it's something that will make you get the pro Max instead of the plus now as far as speakers the 15 Pro Max is so impressive it got louder this year the sound quality is better and typically the regular iPhone including the 14 plus sounded worse than the pro variant but this year I was shocked go ahead and take a listen for [Music] [Music] yourself the 15 plus either sounds identical or very close to the pro MX Max and that is awesome the apple is using really great speakers on both so you don't really get a downside now the next thing I want to talk about is battery life I was also impressed with the battery life of the 15 Pro Max it actually got better even though they didn't quote it getting better but even though the 15 Pro Max has a larger battery the battery life seems to be better on the 15 plus now I didn't do a crazy in-depth test like Mister who's the boss did but in his comparison the 15 plus is the best phone he has ever tested and in the real world you can tell now I was not expecting this because the a17 pro is a 3 nanm compared to the a16 which is a mix of 4 nanm and 5 nanom so should be less efficient right well the A7 Pro actually uses up to 14 watts of power whereas the a16 runs at roughly 10 to 11 so that's up to 40% more power when the phones needs to use high performance that is crazy and that results in some great battery life now thankfully as far as 5G speeds the 15 plus this year has the same x70 as the pro Max which is awesome and that actually saves battery life which is helping it out as well and the speeds compared to the 14 lineup are quite a bit faster both outdoors and indoors and that is really nice to know that this year you're not going to be sacrificing speed and reception now as far as charging speed the 15 Pro Max actually goes up to 27 watts compared to 25 and it takes an hour and 25 minutes for a full charge compared to an hour and 45 minutes and that's just a difference of how much power it accepts throughout the whole charging cycle so it's a little bit quicker now another crazy thing this year is that Apple brought the dynamic Island to the 15 plus where last year it still had add that old Notch and with that we did not expect it to get the super bright xdr display that can hit up to 2,000 nits so outdoor brightness is now the same you get PR level brightness same thing for watching HDR video uh the brightness and quality is identical which is so nice so as far as the screens you're not missing out for the most part but there are a couple stipulations first off you do not get the always on display like get on the 15 Pro Max that is Apple just limiting it and this is nice because you can have widgets you can see your data it is something that I really enjoy and with that you do not get promotion so you get 60 HZ compared to up to 120 so it's definitely noticeable that the pro Max is smoother and if you have a tablet or you had an older phone that had promotion you will notice the 60 HZ being a little bit stuttery but if you have an experience a promotion before you won't know the difference and it's going to be just fine so I wouldn't make that a huge kind of uh deal if you're trying to decide now another difference that we have is the ram last year it was the same but this year the pro Max has bumped up to 8 gigs compared to the same 6 gigs on the plus model now how much of a difference does that make in the real world and to be honest I could not tell both of them did a great job with applications and I think just 6 gigs is a pretty good middle ground where a couple years ago 4 gigs you could see a difference now as far as performance looking at geekbench 6 in the single core we had an 11% difference and in multicore we had a 12% difference to be honest with you guys that does not really matter the a16 bionic is still a great chip and it's going to be supported for another 5 years now in terms of graphics performance here we had a difference of 18% and that is more noticeable but it's still not a massive difference years ago we' have a much bigger difference now one thing I have to point out is the new a17 Pro supports Ray tracing now which gives you more realistic Reflections and shadows and it also has metal effects upscaling which makes it easier on the actual chip to get better graphics with lower draws on the GPU now unfortunately this is brand new we are waiting for games to come out to support this and with that apple is bringing some console level games to the iPhone 15 Pro phones only so you're going to have to have the A7 Pro so if you really enjoy gaming that's something that I would think about now there is one thing that has dominated the headlines with this launch that has to be overheating and throttling people keep talking about the 15 Pro Maxes 15 Pro is getting super hot so did I notice this between the two phones and I will say yes I did I did notice that the 15 Pro Max feels hotter in the hand when you are using it and that because the new titanium is not a great conductor of heat but aluminum is a great one now using these dayto day I don't think that's a massive difference even though when you're charging it gets hotter it feels hotter especially in certain apps that I think still need some optimization but I did a 20-minute throttling Extreme Gaming stress test and what is interesting is that both phones dimed down to the same brightness um when I was running it so the plus didn't really get any better in that regard now right at the end of the test the max had noticeably more heat buildup it hit 47\u00b0 C compared to 44 celsi and on the back side you can actually see the outline of the A7 Pro chip and even a bit of the charging coils now if we look at the results from this test the peak frame rate is roughly 40% higher on the pro Max with the A7 Pro chip but this phone with a titanium throttles so quickly that by the end of loop one the overall performance difference is only 18% and then after the whole test was done when they both heated up the performance difference was 19% so if you're worried about the performance is getting super slow on a pro Max so you're thinking about getting the plus well it ends up being the same once both of them are heated up now the crazy difference though is that the 15 plus cooled off very quickly and the screen went to full brightness after about 30 seconds while on the pro Max it took 2 minutes or longer showing just how good aluminum is um at being able to cool off quickly and dissipate heat so if this is something that you're really worrying about or you want to avoid that is is definitely a plus for the cheaper 15 plus and now it is time to talk about photo quality because this year we have some big differences the 15 plus went up to 48 megapixels and it got some extra features and that is amazing because that makes it a way better phone than the 14 plus but the pro Max now has that 5x lens and believe it or not there's actually benefits uh and negatives with both phones so I have a bunch of pictures here to show you guys and starting out with a 48 megapixel picture they look pretty much identical which is awesome now looking at the selfie cameras here they actually have the same exact hardware and both have Smart H5 so they practically look the same now here's another regular photo it is 48 megapixel it looks great at Sunset and crapping in I would say that the 15 plus looks slightly better and in this shot right here if I punch in and I look once again the 15 plus has slightly more detail now it actually has a newer sensor than the one in the 15 Pro Max which is actually reused from last year so that could be it and now let's talk about the zoom quality because the 15 plus does not have a dedicated zoom lens this shot you guys already saw but I want you guys see the maximum Zoom you could do which is 25 on the pro Max and 10 on the plus even here you see the quality difference and then if I crop in that is a huge difference here the same thing in this shot having the ability to zoom in much more is awesome and the quality looks better too even though you're zoomed in more and based off this sign you guys could see I can clearly read everything on the pro Max whereas the plus it's all garbled up and messed up so if you find yourself zooming in often the pro Max is much better now looking at some portrait shots this 1X looks very similar but on the pro Max you can see where have a little bit better dynamic range now thankfully both of them can take 2x shots now which was a issue with the 14 plus and they look so dang close they look identical but the pro Max now has that 5x telephoto lens and that allows you to get this beautiful bokeh and remove some of the background compared to the plus which 2x is the maximum you can get still looks good but it is not the same here's another shot with the sun in the background I'm getting less um issues with flaring and the image just looks really good with that 5x portrait and the same thing here with this bunny shot I framed it the same but having that extra blur looks really nice in certain cases now both Ultra wide lenses have the same 12 megapixels but the 15 Pro Maxis has autofocus so here I could get really close to that flower compared to the plus that is the closest I can get of course you can crop but then the the quality goes down quite a bit and then here we have a regular ultrawide shot and even looking like this without cropping in the Pro Max looks a little bit more detailed but then if we look at the center you definitely notice that detail and then on the edges the difference is massive so not only do you have the macro mode the overall quality of the lens is better on the pro Max now there is one issue with the pro Max that the plus thankfully doesn't have even though it now shoots 48 megapixels you guys could see here that the pro Max is blurred and that is because the minimal focusing distance is not very good with this 48 megapixel uh camera whereas a plus it looks great and because of this if you're shooting a document or a closeup box right here the pro Max just doesn't do a good job where the plus looks awesome and this is actually how close I can get so you guys can see that difference now I talked about this issue last year when Apple launched this 48 megapixel and the pro phones and you can get around that by using the macro mode but then the quality goes down or by shooting a wide photo and then cropping in the quality also goes down and it's nice to know that you don't have that issue with the plus so if you shoot a lot of documents um things that need close distance that is really nice now going into night mode I thought that the plus would get noticeably worse photos but the shots look pretty much the same and only in the most extreme lighting the 15 Pro Max's slightly larger sensor can pick up a little bit more light and that helps it out now one area where the regular iPhones always struggled is low light portraits so here you guys could see that the pro Max looks so much better and that's because it has that lighter sensor and that allows it to enable night mode with portrait at the same time and that makes the shots look much better if you like taking low light portraits so bringing us back to the the original question should you get the 15 Pro Max or should you save $300 and get the 15 plus well last year I said do not buy the 14 plus there was a massive difference there but this year it is very interesting because Apple added enough to this phone while keeping the base price the same that I would say for a lot of people this is an excellent buy it has great battery life you have the dynamic island in the bright display you have a much better camera before and of course you have USB type-c which while it's not as fast as the pro Maxes most people aren't using it to transfer data anyway so if you're on the fence and you don't need some of the extra luxuries of the pro Max or that zoom lens I would say get the plus you will not be disappointed but if you're going to keep your phone for a very long time you have the money to spend this year the pro Max it's a lot lighter it's more comfortable so you're not um missing out on that benefit of the plus series you can spend the extra money but I was just very impressed with the plus this year and I think it is a great buy you guys let me know your thoughts down in the comments

		"captions": "all right so this is an iPhone 15 and a 15 plus and a 15 Pro and a 15 Pro Max every new phone in the lineup new colors new materials New Ports there's some good stuff to unbox here so let's do it so starting with iPhone 15 and 15 plus this iPhone 15 here is the new blue color and it is I'm just going to go ahead and rename this color to barely blue I think that's an appropriate name because it really is barely giving hints of blue you can really see it on the side rails too but yeah really subtle colors across the board this year anyway the other things in the Box are the paperwork the single white Apple sticker and there is no SIM card ejector tool here since they're all esim at least in the US now but most importantly the new cable in the iPhone box for all new iPhones is a single white braided USB C to usb-c Cable I think this is the first time the iPhone is shipping with a braided nice cable like this so hopefully it'll be a higher quality and more durable than gold cables we've been getting for years so cool USBC cable USBC phone now if we take a look at the plus same idea a bigger box but this new incredibly pale yellow I mean again in perfect lighting at the Apple event I think it looked a little bit more colorful but it just looks extremely pale out here and then we've got the pro boxes for the pro phones as well still White boxes but dark wallpapers so the iPhone 15 Pro I have here is the new dark blue color I almost want to call this one barely blue again but this time it's darker and kind of borders on Gray when the light hits it from certain angles very safe same stuff in the box after that though the paperwork the white Apple sticker and the new braided usb-c cable and then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here is the new natural titanium color and I gotta say guys I think this is going to be the one to get this it's the best color in person in the hand I'll talk more about why in a minute but there you have it the slightly new unboxing experience on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros so by the time you see this I've been testing these phones for about six days now not quite enough time for a review by my standards but still plenty of time to give you some interesting thoughts some things that I've picked up on and some quirks so first of all these pale colors I don't really know how else to say it like this might be totally fine with you I always get told everyone's gonna put a case on their phone which they probably probably are but hey Apple did spend a ton of time and money making this new softer touch satin finish on the back and some of us some of us will carry our phones around with no case so it's worth mentioning for the pro phones there's actually an extra layer of interesting though because they've switched that rail material the part that you actually touch on the outside from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium we've all heard about how much lighter it is and it's something like 10 lighter which is enough for me to notice and enjoy but the other thing is I thought the brushed finish would sort of eliminate fingerprints on the sides absolutely not I was wrong about that I mean it's less it's not as bad as stainless steel but especially on these darker colors like the black or this blue you can totally see fingerprints and sort of wear your hand oils are marking up the sides of the phone and then on top of that this is not anodized like aluminum might be this is the new PVD coating they talked about on stage and it's only been a week here for me and so I don't know exactly how well this will hold up over time but what I do know is if you get a scratch deep enough into this coating it's got to be the natural titanium color underneath which is very light and so that might look rough if you if you drop this phone with no case and get like a big gash on your dark colored phone and have light marks all over it all that to say I I do really think that this natural Titanium or the light is going to be the better color to get on the pros this year okay some things I've noticed in my first week so first of all on the pro the bezels are technically a little bit thinner which makes the buys a little smaller but you really don't notice that much after a few minutes what you do notice more actually visually is the slightly softer curves all the way around these phones seriously on the 15 and 15 Pro because on the 14 it was so square like it just went straight to the edge with a flat display and then it dropped right into the rail at 90 degrees on these new phones the edge of the front glass actually has a little bit of curve at the very edges so it's a softer curve into the rail then the rail itself has softer curves than the totally sharp corners from last year so I think it's a nice hybrid of making it just more comfortable in the hand with these curves but still keeping the generally boxy look now with USBC on these phones we already learned that you can just plug in a cable to charge an accessory right so you it's no reverse wireless charging but you can at least plug in a USBC cable straight to airpods or an Apple Watch magsafe charger whatever and it will charge from your phone's battery so that's all already pretty interesting but I decided it's worth learning all the rules and behaviors of plugging things into the iPhone 15s so here they are so if you plug in any older lightning iPhone into a USBC iPhone regardless of the charge State the USBC iPhone will always give battery to the lightning iPhone every single time no matter what now if you plug in another USBC iPhone into your USBC iPhone it actually does a handshake where they talk to each other figure out which one has the lower battery and then the one with the higher stated charge goes all right I'm a battery bank and I will start charging the one with the lower stated charge all the way till you unplug it so I thought that was pretty interesting and it works pretty well then I decided to try a couple of Android phones and see if the same handshake happened basically what we found is if you plug into your friend's Android phone who has more battery than you and that phone has USB PD it will actually act like a battery bank but if the phone doesn't have USB PD which is a bunch actually right now it's pretty inconsistent and you can end up charging it or it could end up charging you literally unplug and try it again but if it has USB power delivery it will actually do the same handshake that the iPhones do it's only four and a half Watts out so it's not huge it's not going to fast charge or anything but you know it is ideal for accessories you can literally use the cable in the Box to charge up the new airpods or whatever else you want to try but yeah you can rescue another smartphone in a pinch so then the new action button on the pros I was very curious about this I was I was not sure if it would have some restrictions or if there's some things that it wouldn't let you do and it turns out I haven't been able to find any so far it seems like it basically lets you do anything you want and I am very happy about that I mean this was a feature of a lot of Android phones in the past there were some LG phones that did this some Sony phones I want to say some Asus phones I'm hoping it starts to make a bit of a comeback here because on this new iPhone it is great so you jump into the settings and go to action button and it loads up this whole crazy UI that's just like nothing like any of the other settings pages on the iPhone like they just stapled this in here but okay and as I showed you in The Impressions video you can do any number of pre-programmed things with this button by default it is still the mute switch that it replaces and it has those two different haptic patterns so when you mute it in your pocket you know exactly what you're doing without even checking you did it correctly but honestly I don't know I leave my phone on mute most of the time anyway so you can also have it open up the camera in any of the camera modes but then again the camera shortcut is like right on your lock screen already and I'm pretty used to that same thing with the flashlight you could do that but it's also already on everyone's lock screen screen I like the voice memo trigger it's actually pretty convenient because it immediately starts recording when you press and hold the button but my favorite by a mile is the series shortcuts function because it basically lets you do anything else you can have it you can stack up a bunch of different functions that are like location dependent or you can have it call a certain contact or do certain things or if you just want to literally open any app on your phone with zero lag so it could be your to-do list app or your calendar app or just open YouTube with any one button press whatever you want for me I'm going to map my action button on my brand new iPhone to the Google Assistant the best assistant available on the iPhone also Apple if you're listening I also wish you could map a double press or a triple press of the action button to a new specific function just think about it also I was kind of curious how cases would handle this new action button so I asked Channel sponsor dbrand to send over their new ghost case and I have it here personally pretty solid I think this matte black skeleton design looks sick and yes I can confirm that even with the case the action button still feels nice and clicky now you might be thinking all right what's so special about this clear case I've seen a million clear cases and between the skeleton and magsafe if there's a bunch of other stuff but my favorite personally is if you've ever owned a clear case before you probably know that after a while it kind of ends up looking like this just disgusting and yellow but dbrand has promised me that they've specifically engineered the ghost case to be impossible to Yellow and they use those words themselves so they actually give you like a lifetime case replacement guarantee if it ever yellows so that's either a real promise or free cases for life the way I see it either way if you're interested I'll leave a link below the like button if you want to check it out that's the dbrand ghost case now I've also been taking some pictures and videos with these new cameras to get a sense of how they perform I will be taking many many more posting them on on Twitter if you want to follow me there Instagram as well I also fully plan on shooting the next autofocus car Channel video with this phone so you already know you can go subscribe over there to see how the video looks to hear how the microphones sound one thing that they did mention in the keynote specifically was there was a new coating over the lenses that I immediately thought oh does this fix the horrible night time flare issues with the iPhone's video first thing I did was go to a dark room bring it out at night shoot with some lights no it didn't fix it unfortunately I'm sure the coding does some other great stuff during the daytime but there's still flare issues sadly but also lastly I want to clarify the new camera behavior on the pro phones in The Impressions video I was a little down on the whole like 1X versus 1.2x for versus 1.5 x thing because I thought it was literally just a digital crop which would be pretty pointless to me but it's actually closer to a set of super res Zoom presets that you can actually then digitally Zoom between I'll detail all this in the full reviews and here's some benchmark scores in case you're curious about that sort of thing for performance for the a17 pro which is actually new uh but generally I think that wraps up my first Second Impressions my second look now that I got him in the studio really I feel like the base iPhone 15s if you're thinking if if you want to buy one of these or pre-order them it's a bigger Improvement than it seems on paper like nothing is actually new here but because it's bringing things from last year's Pro phone it's actually a very solid phone and then the pro it's a lot more interesting because there's some genuinely new stuff happening I've seen new stuff with the cameras also it seems like someone found out the batteries are slightly bigger across the board which is good too we'll see if that holds up but generally let me know what you want to see in the full reviews in the comment section below because I will be working on those over the next couple days and weeks and hopefully you'll see that soon either way thanks for watching catch in the next one face [Music]"

Pro not a lot of changes so okay I think people got to get this thought out of their head that you've got to upgrade every year to the newest phone like I realized most of us already know this but for some reason people are still stuck on this thing where they say oh last year's phone is is barely different from this year's phone it's not worth upgrading but like that's not new like the Zenfone 10 I just reviewed is just a refinement of the Zenfone 9 like the bleeding edge Rog phone has looked the same for three years now the pixel is finding its stride with design but what we're really looking for is for them to fix anything that's wrong or bad and then just find ways clever ways good interesting ways to just get a little bit better every year so that over a long time over a bunch of improvements it adds up to a bigger more significant change so that's what's happening here with this iPhone 15 Pro I've been using it for about two weeks now they've made some improvements but now we're starting to also see some possible problems some new issues that have risen up so uh let's talk about it so there's basically four new features they've added here I'm gonna go over some of the more fundamental and existential stuff in the regular iPhone 15 review so definitely make sure you're subscribed to see that when it comes out but for the pro it's time to Deep dive on the stuff that's unique to this one the uh professional stuff that being the build the chip the cameras and the action button so easiest place to start is the way they've built this phone so Apple made an update to the build and the materials of the iPhone this year they've softened the corners a little bit it's clearly still a boxy design but you know now instead of a completely flat glass at the front there's this gentle little curve just at the very edges I think that'll maybe make screen protectors slightly more intricate but I think it has a nice look to it and then the screen sizes are exactly the same but now the bezels are actually a tiny bit Slimmer all the way around so technically the phone is like one millimeter smaller diagonally and the rails have famously switched from that shiny stainless steel to a lighter coated and brushed titanium the result it's very slightly better I think it's fun it's kind of funny I've always Associated a heavy phone with like expensive feeling you know like the ceramic phones are like extra heavy they feel like substance but I understand why people want it to be lighter and so this phone is actually noticeably lighter than the previous Pro it's it's 10 on paper but it feels like more than 10 and then there's a new set of colors too so I'm sticking with it this new natural titanium is the best color this is the first year I am not ordering a dark or black iPhone they still look good don't get me wrong but they get all kinds of fingerprints on them like crazy and also my worries about the light colored scratches if you go deep enough we're all confirmed by Zach j-rig everything in his video cutting the thing up so because I'm on team no case I'm going with the all gray phone I think it looks dope so I'm going with that I think basically the idea is if if you have a perfectly working phone there's no world where you should upgrade to this one just for the titanium build or just for the slightly thinner bezels but you have to appreciate put this up next to an iPhone 11 then yeah you can see the differences compounding over time just like if you sat in a 992 generation 911 right now after sitting in a 997 generation car but the real highlight of this build here let's be honest is uh there's a new Port at the bottom that USB type c which makes a big difference to people like me who have other Gadgets in their life computers headphones mouse keyboard I just bring one charger it works with everything I have already had this rite of passage moment that everyone who gets this phone is going to have where you have an existing lightning cable and you try to plug it in and then you're like oh right new cable but now I've gotten used to it but the thing is I could I could have sworn Apple would do more with this port like okay we know that they're basically forced into doing this by the EU so shout out to the EU for that now I have a USB iPhone but like the only pitch is just hey one cable for everything that's it Apple really so like with 30 pin to lightning all those years ago the benefit was obvious it's just so much smaller of a port so that let them fit more stuff in the phone plus it's reversible now with this USB type c it's like okay it was already small it was already reversible charging speed did not improve at all it's still 25 watts there's no extra like desktop mode plug it into a monitor and get there's no decks or anything like that right it's just one cable for everything okay fine sure welcome to the club you know iPhone users can now take advantage of the you in USBC I talked about the handshake it does with plugging directly into other phones and reverse charging them at four and a half watts in the unboxing video that's pretty neat you can also plug in other things plug in a keyboard and type with it plug in a monitor it'll mirror your screen at up to 4K 60. and the profile now supports USB 3.0 data transfer speeds so you can get that prores footage off the phone noticeably faster and you can actually for the first time shoot video directly onto an external drive now there's some talk about the cable that comes in the Box remember that nice high quality braided USBC cable that comes in the Box but it's only USB 2.0 transfer speeds it's a slow cable so if you have a pro phone you need to get a faster separate cable for it that seemed weird to people but it's not that's very normal most smartphones come with just a USBC cable just to charge it's a charging cable if you wanted a data cable you'd have to buy a thicker more robust cable that looks the same but as a data cable it's kind of confusing and annoying actually welcome to the world of USBC my friends it's good to have you but that is a good segue to the main enabler the new Powerhouse chip inside this phone with a new name the a17 pro so the base iPhone 15s got last year's a16 bionic from the 14 pro and so here's this new more powerful chip in the highest end phones and it's not The a17 Bionic this is the first one with the pro Name a17 Pro and this thing goes kind of crazy on paper this is their first three nanometer chip actually the first three nanometer chip in any phone that we'll probably see for at least another year or two I ran some benchmarks it's literally approaching M1 chip levels of synthetic benchmark scores now compared to last year it's 10 to 20 percent more powerful on both the CPU and the GPU which is very respectable but more power is like more horsepower in a car it's only really useful or noticeable if it lets you do more things with it I'm going to live in this analogy a bit more for a minute but like the last generation Porsche 911 Turbo S it was already so ballistic fast that you never approach that limit anywhere on public streets until you get to the highest end of performance on the track and the highest end iPhone is the same way like the pro iPhone's been great at just surfing Instagram and texting and doing all the normal web browsing basic stuff you do on a phone and so the only place you'd really notice the extra performance is well we got a gaming demo Apple showed these wild demos on the new iPhone at the keynote and uh just a disclaimer I'm not much of a phone gamer so I'll defer the commentary on this to dave2d you can go watch his video link below but they literally launched exclusive games on the iPhone that are like Resident Evil Village and Assassin's Creed but not on Cut Down mobile versions these are literally the same versions with the same assets and same textures and everything from the PlayStation version because it literally is the PlayStation version that's impressive plus you know performance Headroom is never a bad thing but I think also for me and for a lot of other people the more impactful things that you'll actually notice about this new chip are in the dedicated parts of it that are for specific tasks like the new image signal processor lets you take really really fast lag free photos constantly the new neural engine recognizes portrait mode subjects like people's faces and dogs and cats automatically and lets you go back in time and set a regular photo to a portrait mode photo the USB 3 controller that enables faster data transfer speeds is also on the a17 pro all of that is coming from the new chip but what I'm more concerned with at the moment is battery life okay so actually it's kind of two main issues that have been popping up that you kind of have to try to figure out are they isolated issues are these real problems with the phone and those are battery life and overheating issues and to be honest part of the reason this review took like longer than normal is I've had I've been really trying to dig into the battery and figure out what's going on here so objectively speaking these phones have slightly bigger batteries than last year and a new three nanometer chip so in a controlled environment they should do better and they do they literally last longer on like simple Benchmark stuff so that's good news now when I test a phone like normal I pretty much I kind of go by feel I always have some mix of good days some average days and then some bad days where I can sort of figure out what's draining it what its weaknesses are and I can come to a conclusion from that so now here we are I get a couple days in I get a couple weeks in and I've had a good amount of average days I've had a couple of those bad draining days but I also haven't had any of those amazing days where I got like nine hours of screen on time I just haven't had any yet and then we also started to see some of those headlines about battery life potentially being worse and there's also some overheating issues popping up on Twitter or X and some people were asking if mine has had any issues so here's the weird answer yes but not what I would expect I was two days ago literally I was just at a golf tournament it was in Florida it was like a 100 degree real feel something crazy like that and I'm outside with my phone at Max brightness with GPS going all day out in the sun and it was fine no problem no overheating issues but then a couple hours later I'm on the airplane with my phone in airplane mode and I've got just like music playing on Bluetooth with Spotify and like scrolling through Instagram and for like five minutes the phone just gets really hot and just blasts through like five percent battery and then it's fine again afterwards and I'm like there there almost seems to be no Rhyme or Reason why it does this randomly once in a while so my best theory is that the a17 pro is just it's a more powerful chip and so therefore is able to drain power more quickly than before in high intensity settings like gaming Etc and there's also been some issues attributed to iOS 17 bugs like we're already on 17.0.2 I imagine there's some more updates coming to both iOS and a bunch of apps but by the end of this I kind of feel like I'm expecting battery life to basically even out to be the same as last year which is a boring answer but that's kind of what I expect now we can talk all we want about what the word Pro actually means in a smartphone but with iPhones that is mostly meant cameras and uh it turns out there is a lot going on with these relatively similar looking cameras on these new Pro phones both in hardware and software so you're looking at a new bigger 48 megapixel main camera there's also an improved Ultra wide with a closer up macro capability and a whole telephoto situation and that will get to in a minute but then with software there is this whole new intricate image processing pipeline happening so you know how most smartphones a lot of them today have like 48 megapixel cameras and they all bend down to 12 megapixels they give you 12 megapixel shots you know previous iPhones did this um this new one for those who might have missed it is actually by default spitting out 24 megapixel images instead of 12. and it's only about one and a half times the file size so this new process which is the same actually across the board for iPhone 15s and 15 Pros is it's taking a 48 megapixel full sensor shot for detail information and also taking a full sensor 12 megapixel shot which is the quad binning for light information and noise and then it's using the neural net to combine them and do a sort of a detail transfer to get you this hybrid 24 megapixel image it's very complicated very clever and the end result is slightly better it's really right in line with what I've been saying so if you just generally look at photos shot on this camera it's it's an iPhone photo like they look pretty great they're awesome with dynamic range and sharpness across the board I still prefer and shoot in the rich contrast profile most of the time but yeah mostly the iPhone is one of the best cameras at just pointing and shooting in full auto just getting results that look good even if it doesn't look the most like real life you know it's doing the classic re-lighting and tone mapping and everything we're used to from all this smart HDR it's all here and a lot of people like it and it looks good uh the improved macro mode is also really good and with this natural fall off with the primary camera without even needing portrait mode you can get some blurred backgrounds it's awesome autofocus is also really really fast especially whenever there's a face in the scene this thing loves seeing faces and the benefit of the bigger sensor shows itself at night too with even longer handheld captures it's not magic it's just physics but you know does the 24 megapixel make a difference over the 12 megapixel well zoomed out absolutely not they look basically the same so you got to zoom in and even at 50 Zoom you still can't really tell it's not until you zoom all the way in that you can okay you can see a difference you can start to notice a difference in fine detail and contrast the 15 Pro is definitely one you're pixel peeping more contrasty and sharp when you're all the way zoomed in versus last year but that's just when you've zoomed all the way in and by the way once you get past 2x Zoom it's back to kicking out regular 12 megapixel images so again this is it's like it's a small small year-over-year improvement with that tiny amount of like pixel peeping detail but over a longer distance over a bunch of generations that's the type of thing that adds up they even on the pro phones did a couple of presets from the 1X lens there's a 24 millimeter all the way zoomed out then a 28 millimeter a little bit tighter and a 35 millimeter that all have their own dedicated image processing pipeline press sets to maximize detail into these basically super res Zoom focal lengths that you can digitally Zoom between I wouldn't exactly call it having extra lenses on the phone but you know 1.5 x zoom on last year's phone versus 1.5 x zoom on this year's phone slight difference but there is a difference honestly the most Pro things about these new phones though is definitely their video cameras so I'm just going to nerd out about these for a second because the iPhone's video capabilities I've talked about this so much but they are still so clearly far out in front of the rest of the smartphone World it doesn't even shoot 8K which is it's totally capable of with the 48 megapixels I wish they would let us but even just at 4K 30 in full auto the detail the autofocus the slight depth the dynamic range the stabilization they're all world class I mean if you want to just look at test footage the entire electric rivian delivery van review I did on the autofocus channel was shot on iPhone 15 Pro Audio included I'll drop the link below if you want to watch that whole thing also shout out to the New av1 Codex support on the chip that's going to play nice with YouTube but this year you can also shoot log literally a pro camera feature now it is annoyingly buried several layers deep in the separate Settings app which is really not very Pro but if you find the time to go switch over there and get into log the iPhone will shoot with way more information that classic flat log look dynamic range everything and you don't have to deal with whatever Apple was going to do with over sharpening and saturation and processing Apple has its own transformation Lut to turn it into SDR or HDR or you can go in and fully grade it yourself to really get the most out of the iPhone's video and it looks really like really really good so the one thing that I'm going to say to you know because I'm pixel peeping at this point is the haloing from point light sources you know it's one of the hardest challenges with these tiny Optics so I get why they haven't just fixed it yet but like it's pretty bad anytime there's any sort of Point lights especially with video despite whatever new lens coating they're doing it's pretty dramatic and it seems like it's the worst on the iPhone of any other phone so it's there gonna point it out again but hey if that's the biggest downside of iPhone video I'll definitely take it and then iPhone 15 Pro Max the big one is the only one that comes with the new 5x larger telephoto lens uh I would bet my life that that's going to come down to the smaller 16 Pro next year whatever but it's only the big one this time but yeah it does let you get a little further with Max Zoom from 15x to 25x it's nice if you do a lot of Zoom photos and videos which is a very specific crowd there's some people that do that you know concert goers things like that but there are just very few people who should buy one just for this lens because it also means you have to have a bigger phone and it also happens to mean that your 4X photos just before you get to 5x will actually be worse on this phone but yeah it's not nearly as capable as some of the longer telephoto periscope soap lens I mean Samsung has a 10x Optical lens that blows this one out the water in terms of reach I think Apple's main advantage really is just stabilization like they finally do that zoom in preview window on the corner of the viewfinder and they over stabilize the frame so you can zoom all the way in and get a shot in super creeper mode it's it's great but I'm just going to shamelessly borrow a line from Mr mobile because he said it as well as anyone possibly could and he's right which is just that so much of the differences between these cameras this one the last iphone the Samsungs the pixels of the world so much of the difference between them is software that is hardly even consistent anymore so if you are looking for like a hard verdict on like iPhone 15 Pro side by side versus Samsung versus pixel or Oppo or whatever else you kind of just have to make it up after a while like yeah there are going to be certain instances like exact Zoom focal lengths where one is sharper than the other but honestly at the end of the day a lot of it is going to be taste and so yeah yeah you just kind of have to figure out which one you like as far as image quality and especially UI just the actual way you shoot photos and videos which reminds me I do want to mention this raw Max button is hilarious this is this is a button to to take your full res 48 megapixel Pro Raw photos but it just says raw Max okay and if you want a 48 megapixel jpeg you have to jump back into the settings app switch it over then bounce back and now the button says jpeg Max which is also hilarious last thing I gotta say though this new Pro phone has an action button on this new Pro iPhone only because only pros need customization look I kind of love the action button but I also need to realize that it's it's it's kind of either overrated or underrated depending on who you are like on one hand it's literally a customizable button like who even saw this coming it replaces the least used button that was on previous iPhones because your phone should always be on mute anyway and so then you can map this action button to basically anything you want you can keep it as a mute switch and it has the same strong haptics so you can tell if it's muted or unmuted in your pocket without looking but there's also a bunch of other cool functions you can pick from from launching your camera to a voice recorder to just literally any app on your phone you want through a Siri shortcut your favorite YouTube channel right now is probably making a tutorial on the best series shortcuts to map to the action button from launching apps to to the specific things inside of apps from unlocking your car to not just launching my favorite task manager app but launching a new task inside of of my task manager app it just lets me it's great it's awesome honestly I hope it gets copied even though a bunch of phones were doing this years ago and then they stopped I hope they bring it back now in response to how great this is but on the other hand I I do kind of feel like for a lot of people this is gonna be one of those things that they play with for like a three or four days and then just kind of forget about it and never use it again and I mostly think that's because it's not super reachable like it's not a one-handable button where your fingers usually rest for everyone especially on the pro Max it's way up there in the corner above the volume buttons it could be a cool shutter button for the camera but the volume buttons already do that so yeah I feel like you might as well just end up setting it back to a mute switch and forgetting about it after a few weeks but I guess that's fine too it's one of those things that you'll just figure out which user you are after you use it for a while kind of like I've been using the new that eight Sleep mattress cover that I was talking about I've been using it for about three months now this is the Pod cover that goes on your mattress that either warms you up or cools you down helps you sleep like now that I've used it for a while I've understood like I was a skeptic at first but honestly this is one of those things where I go to a hotel bed and I have a harder time sleeping which it used to be the other way around but I just sleep so much better in the eight sleep bed because it's cooled down to let you get to sleep early and then warms up in the morning to help you wake up and it's become really clear that temperature is one of the most important factors when it comes to sleep and it's become real obvious to me that falling asleep faster getting better quality sleep and then being able to depend on it is something I wouldn't trade for anything it's just it took me some time to learn that plus there's an app that shows me all my info about my sleep every night and it lets me adjust the autopilot if I want if your partner sleeps at a different side on the same bed they can adjust the temperature in the app too it's great so I'll leave a link to it below and since they're a great sponsor they're actually giving you guys 200 off the Pod cover if you use code MKBHD at eightsleep.com MKBHD but anyway what's the verdict what's the what's the verdict with the new Pro iPhone of 2023. is one of those things where like I have conversations with friends and I always end up having to try to condense it all and summarize it into like one sentence and the truth is like it's the same phone as last year with USB a little bit of a faster chip a little bit of a brighter screen a little bit of thinner bezels and like I don't know better cameras that's kind of it so you have to decide how much of that is important to you are any of those things important to you honestly USB might be the most important thing about the new iPhone despite what Apple was hoping welcome to the club my friends thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] foreign"

		"captions": "Greetings to everyone. I hope you are having a good time. We will examine the two brothers you see in front of me. I say brother, but they are the new big brothers of the iPhone. I have the iPhone 15 Plus in my right hand and the iPhone 15 Pro Max in my left hand. Both of them are compared to the previous series, in this case, they are compared to the iPhone 14 Pro max.  There are significant changes in this compared to the iPhone 14 Plus. I will talk about these from time to time. But I want to compare these two in a nice way. I did the camera tests on both of them, since I took videos of them separately. I did it there and compared the two side by side. The results were a little different than I expected. Anyway, let's not make it too long, let the comparison begin. Yes sir, our 2 devices are here. When you look at the boxes, there is no difference. Both of them look like the same phone because of the Dynamic separations. The top side looks like this. It sparkles on the sides and it says iPhone according to its color. The box is the box we are used to, there is no change. Let's open both of them. By the way, since I have examined both of these devices, I opened them beforehand. We will do a false unboxing like this. I take the phones aside and when we look at the contents of the box, they are exactly the same. There is no difference. Now let the devices come. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is in blue Titanium color and the iPhone 15 Plus is in green color. But I believe this is green. I love the color, let me show you this, it is close to white, but here are the places where the camera is, the sides and so on are a darker green, it will harm the back, I think it is very stylish, it looks Premium, when we look at the back, there is nothing different from the previous generation, again, there are two diagonal cameras in the Plus, there are two diagonal cameras in the Pro Max.  There are 3 cameras in the phone, even the sensors are in the same place. When we look at the phones from the front, 2 liters are almost exactly the same. When it comes to Dynamic, there is not much difference in the front view. It may not be very noticeable. Only the frames you see on the side of the Pro Max are thinner, but there is not a huge difference from the side. When we look at the side, this volume up section is still a notch on the 15 Plus, while on the Promax there is an action button, it is called the action button. Apart from that, there are not many differences physically. And of course, an important change has come to both types of things. Now we have said goodbye to the Lightning cable, which is a good thing.  Because I was so bored carrying a few cables around with me, I have an AirPods, an iPad, a Macbook and an iPhone. One of them is charging via Lightning, the other one is also charging. Frankly, it was a bit annoying, but fortunately, Apple had to step back due to European Union standards. First of all, I want to start with the colors. iPhone 15 Plus has 5 different colors, including black, blue, green, pink and yellow. Pro Max came in 4 different colors. What you see is blue titanium, black titanium, white titanium and Natural titanium. It has a slightly more yellowish tone at the starting prices.  As for this, this may change. The iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at 76.99 TL, the 256 GB model because you can buy at least 256 GB. The iPhone 15 Plus has a price of 56.999 TL, the lowest model is 128 GB. Both of them have 3 different capacities.  Pro Max comes with 256 GB, 512 GB and one terabyte options. Plus comes in 3 different capacities: 128 GB, 256 GB and 512 GB. Both have the same screen size. They both have a 6.7-inch superretine xcr OLED screen, and the pixel densities are exactly the same.  460 ppi But unfortunately, there is a difference, every Zeri has different screen refresh rates. Pro max has Pro motion technology, so I can say that it is variable, it oscillates between 120 Hertz at each time, but you always see the screen with the fluency of 120 Hertz, again on the 15 Plus. Unfortunately, it has a great refresh rate of 60. I can't believe it either, the year is 2023. You are selling phones worth over 50 thousand lira and it is still 60+. I really wanted it to be at least a 90. They did not do it and there is another difference in their screens, you know, we have seen Alwayson Display in the 14 Pro family. This feature is available on the 15 Pro and 15 Pro max, but they did not bring it to the 15 and 15 Plus models. It does not have an always-on display feature and they also introduced material separation. It was already there last year, while it was aluminum, the normal models were stainless steel. They completely eliminated stainless steel. Titanium is what I said. Now let's come to the chip part, things are quite different here. There is a pair called a17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro max, and it has the first three nanometer transistor gap used in phones, and this makes it very important. Because when the transistor gap narrows, an efficiency emerges.  It starts to consume less three. So, right here, they announced that they will separate poro and normal models as chips. You know, the progress of this was coming from last year. I want to say the weights. While iPhone 15 Plus is 201 grams, iPhone 15 Pro Max is 221 grams. There is a weight difference of 20 grams between them. This range was more. The weight of iPhone 15 Pro Max was reduced compared to 14 Pro Max, so they are a little closer, which means the material used.  It's all about changing things, and when we look at the details from the side, the 15 Plus is thinner, as you've already read in the dimensions, there is a very small difference of 0.45 mm between them, but the reason for this is related to the depth of the camera lenses, both of them are resistant to soy and dust, both have the same IP68 certification.  It can last up to 6 meters deep for 30 minutes. Now let's move on to the camera part. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has 4 cameras in total, while the iPhone 15 Plus has 3 cameras in total. The iPhone 15 Plus model does not have a telepathy camera. And of course, when you look at the back, there is no Leader sensor.  These are the things that distinguish the phone. Let's start with the main camera. iPhone made a different move and brought a 48 megapixel camera to the regular 15 family, and Pro and Pro max also have a 48 megapixel camera. Is it not the same camera? We already understand this from the data on paper. Yes, they are the same resolution, but They differ in aperture. The iPhone 15 Pro Max's camera has an aperture of f1.78 and a room distance of 24 millimeters. As for the iPhone 15 Plus, it has an aperture of F16 and a room distance of 26 millimeters. Now let me summarize in general. The aperture data on paper. iPhone 15 Plus is ahead, but I think the sensor sizes are different, I could not find this detail on the internet. But according to the tests I have done, I am sure that the sensor is larger because the iPhone 15 Pro Max takes better shots. And the focal lengths I mentioned are also different. iPhone 15 Pro Max is compared to the iPhone 15 Plus. One of them shoots a little wider, the other one is 26 millimeters, the other is 24 mm, as this mm decreases, it shoots wider. Let me quickly point out for those who don't know. As for the ultra wide angle camera, different sensors are used. Both are 12 megapixels. The aperture value in Pro max is f2.2. The aperture value in 15 plus is f2.4 They both have a focal length of 13 millimeters. That is, they shoot at the same width. Of course, Pro Max has a third camera, which is a telephoto camera. It is a sensor that can do 5x optical zoom, that is, it has a 120 millimeter room slide. It has an aperture value of 2.8 and I use this sensor.  I liked it very much, but when the light is good, you can take excellent photos and videos. Especially the photography part is very good, but when it gets dark, it makes you a little sad, it makes you miserable in the video, you will see the test anyway. Both of them have sensor-based Optical stabilization, but the two are separated from each other. Because it is called the second generation. There is optical stabilization in Pro Max and in Plus, it is 1 generation. Again, I have already run and done something. You will see the stabilization difference. You can read the common features of both cameras on the side. But let me tell you where I differ, for a better comparison, both of these phones have a night mode.  But you can use the night mode when taking portrait shots in Pro Max, you cannot use it in Plus. You can take Macro shots in Pro Max, but you cannot do it in Plus. There is no macro support, and the scissors of 15 Pro Max are incredibly beautiful, I liked it very much, it has been improved a lot, I was able to shoot everything by getting in the bottom. I will talk about a difference. In Pro Max, you can take raw photos. This feature is not available in Plus. Let's talk about the front camera. Both of them use 12 megapixel cameras with f1. But let me tell you this, the cameras used in the iPhone 15 have changed a lot compared to the iPhone 14, that is, the quality has increased tremendously. For example, there was a huge difference in the front camera between the 14 and 14 Pro. There is no such difference here. As for the video recording side, all the cameras on these two phones you see are 4K 60. If you want to shoot, you can shoot up to 4K 30 frames, audio final night shots, slow motions up to 240 black, etc. They are all exactly the same, I will continue by saying their differences, as in photography, there is no Macro in the video, there is no Macro in Plus, you can take Macro shots in Pro Max, in video and iftar.  Whether it's time-lapse or slow-down, macro works on all of them and I really liked it. They improved the macro a little more. You can take Pro still shots in Pro Max, but you can't in Plus. You can shoot in look format in Pro Max, but you can't in Plus. There is also the Academy, encoding  There is such a thing as system, this is a situation that concerns mostly those who make colours. It is available in Pro Max, but not in Plus. [ Music] Yes, now you can see it from the front cameras. Both of them are 4K 60 frames. My son is a communist. Yes, this is this friend right now. What was this identity? He escaped.  It's Pro Max. Here, right now, let's hear it 15 km away. Brats are shouting behind us, they're playing ball like this. Yes, we came and went, we are running outside, we are working, we are testing, I want to look at living things, man, there may be a difference in the liveliness of the screen, we will see it when we put it on the computer. You can also write your comments. Yes, we are in cinematic mode now, elite.'  I 'm turning towards e again. I'm back, let's do our eyes too, I was joking. Yes, cinematic mode. The performance is like this. Both of them can shoot 4K 30 frames. Yes, we are currently recording video. Both of them are 4K 60 frames. Kariza's son of speed. Look at how he closes those glasses. Look at the ward. [Music]  ] It's shaking in my hand. By the way, pay attention to the stabilization, I couldn't talk, let me show you around. Let's even do a stabilization, I'm running, the motion mode was off at the moment. Yes, now we're in cinematic mode, 4K 30 frames on the rear cameras, both of them are moving away, but I'm turning to the right ass. Yes, both of them are here. I swear it's recorded. Okay sir.  Yes, now we will try super stabilization, movement mode, that is, I am running, both of them are mostly 2.8k 60 frames. I swear, I am running hard right now, pulling myself up. Lead. It will also be very close. It will probably be very close, but wait, let's get our pants on. Let's see, we've started and people are looking at this freak. What? [Music] Yes, there is an iPhone 15 Pro Max here. There is also an iPhone 15 Plus here. By the way, we are shooting 4K 30 frames. The reason why we shot this is when we increase it to 60, the image becomes a little darker as the last shutter speed is increased. That's why we decided to shoot it at 4K 30, keep in mind.  Do not shoot at 60 frames in very dark weather. This is the low shot. This is information about the little ones, so let 's continue before finishing. This is how you hear my voice on the iPhone 15 Pro max. This is how my voice sounds to you. This is how you hear my voice on the iPhone 15 Plus.  Let him move from right to left. Even Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Germany is unnecessarily cold, you are burning in Turkey right now. You are probably here, I am frozen, it is not for me. The man walks around in short sleeves, I am used to it. My delicate body cannot get used to this.  So now we went to Ultra wide. Yes, we went to Ultra wide. There was a reverse. The light is beautiful now. Yes, I moved a little bit behind the light source to understand better. I 'm switching to 2x. The comments are for you. I'll put them side by side. You'll see them simultaneously. Or there will be the same images on Se\u00e7kin's channel.  He might have also put it on. Wait, let me see. Wait a minute. I adjusted the vaccine. Yes, do you know what I see here? Lady in 15 Plus. That feeling. The connection features of both phones will be on the same side. You can read it here. I don't want to extend it by telling all of them.  It has safe support. By the way, you can charge up to 15 watts in Max safe, but when we came to the tip shop, everyone thought like me that the charging speeds and current would increase. For example, last year, 27 watts were used in Promax and 20 watts were used in Plus, as you know, nothing has changed.  watt can still draw 20 watts, and there were rumors in the video I shot, there were rumors that it would increase to 35 watts or 40 watts. It didn't work, we couldn't do it. What are you doing now? Since the phones are new, it is very difficult to say how long the battery life lasts. You have to experience it for a long time. I'm talking based on the data on paper, I didn't watch the online video. Apple says that the Pro Maxi takes 25 hours of charging, while the Plus takes 20 hours of charging. There is a 20-25% difference between them. The reason for this is probably related to the A7 Pro bionic, which has the new 3 nanometer chip I mentioned. Ben 14 Pro I'm using Max right now, I haven't switched yet to 15 Pro Max and I was n't happy with the battery life at all. Let's see, I hope things have been fixed and they have eliminated the heating problem. I hope I don't think so. Because I feel the phone getting hot sometimes, especially when I put it on charger, the phone burned to death. If you are not following me on Instagram today.  You can follow my experiences from there. I will share them in the story from time to time. Yes, I tried to explain their differentiating features. What do you think about this issue? Do you think the 20,000 lira price difference between them is worth it? Say it in the comments. Please do not write this. It is not worth anything for that money, etc. I am not talking about these, compare the two.  And there is a 30% price difference between them. I just want you to comment on whether it is worth it. I just think that these phones should not be paid this much. Especially in this day and age, but we do. This is our job. Probably if I wasn't doing this job, I wouldn't pay this much money. I would buy something cheaper for the phone. But because it is related to my job and I use it all the time, it comes back, I take pictures with my phone, that's why I feel obliged to buy the best quality, I need to keep up to date and share updated information with you. But as I said, is it worth this price difference? I want you to make this interpretation, I will make my interpretation.  Yes, if I am a content creator, I would definitely prefer Pro Maxi. I will pay the money in between. But if I am a standard user, I do what I see, I text, I browse social media, I watch things, etc. This is too much, that's enough, let me tell you the only thing that bothers you is the name of the screen refresher, I'm 60, I'm great.  I can't use a phone because 120 always feels like it takes 60 letters when you get used to it, it seems like it gets stuck. It can be adapted to that too. In fact, after a certain amount of use, but it feels like an ordeal. I'm really stuck with this fluidity. By the way, if you have Pro Max etc. before and then switch to this, you may have some trouble. Thank you for watching the video. I have two videos on the side. You can continue watching me by clicking on one of them. I'm running away now. Take care of yourself. Goodbye bye."

		"captions": "[Music] what's up Brian Tong here and there is so much to talk about what is Apple doing about the overheating reports for the iPhone 15 Pro and yeah you know I put it in air quotes for a reason I've got thoughts on the videos coming back for damage and drop tests yeah plus is Apple's fine woven case really trash also new iPhone 16 reports and will there be an October Apple event that's all in this video but first let's get to it because Apple has made a statement and officially plans to release an iOS 17 update to address what they call a bug that could contribute to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max overheating now here's what they said to Forbes and Mac Rumors in a statement we have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected the device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity we've also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update another issue involves some recent updates of third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system we're working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out now this statement calls out what has been the case almost every year it gets warm during setup it always has but they're also calling out that some third-party apps like Instagram and Uber that overload the system and get your phone super hot I'm actually the one naming the names of the apps not Apple themselves but apple is saying that a bug also exists for some users and that points to more of a software issue than Hardware according to them and let me be clear before this statement came out that the talk about iPhone 15 pro and pro Max's overheating in some cases was true but it was also completely overblown like I'd say 80 percent of people that I talked to had no issue with it whatsoever but there were absolutely certain apps like Instagram where the heat would jump up and there's a difference between being warm versus being too hot to touch again I am saying I know it happened in some cases but when Tech Traders just jump on a tweet and say it got so hot they offer no real evidence we don't know where they live the temperature and then they never mentioned their iPhone is fine now because it was probably running hot for a few hours as it was indexing and processing everything in the background it's the true definition of a hot take now apples also said that the issue is not related to hardware and the titanium frame and a new design and the 15 Pro's new design does not contribute to the overheating because there were reports from the rumor Mills that leaned into the overheating reports and said that there were compromises made in the thermal system design now Apple says the titanium and aluminum substructure provides better heat dissipation so after all this after the software fix we'll see how that plays out over time because I'm not taking any sides here but we just have to wait and see how it plays out over time and I personally never had any extreme overheating issues and I'd honestly like to see in the comments how many of you did or didn't okay how hot did it really get and if you did is it still hot or was it just that first day now we don't know when that new software update is coming from Apple but you know I will let you know when it does and also with the new iPhone release since this is a new titanium model it meant a comeback for the damage and Drop Test videos and I'm not throwing shade at creators doing their thing but if you drop something enough times and try to damage something it will break like I've had a phone break after one drop and I've had that same phone survive five plus drops and I've had people come to me and say did you see the iPhone 15 Pro breaks so much more easily but come on if you're trying to break something you will succeed 100 of the time unless it's made of vibranium or Advantium then then it will never break so I get that there's a shock value attached to them but where are all the people right now right now posting their videos of their broken phones that happen in a normal situation if these things are so much easier at breaking it's not happening because we're not trying to break them please like feel free to bend your phone until the point of breaking just cause and let me know how that works out for you okay but if you love Tech right if you really love it why are you trying to destroy it like that's where I'm at that's where I've always been with this from day one and you can choose to either agree or disagree with me in this lovely place called the comments but if there was one product that deserves all the criticism it's getting it has to be Apple's fine woven cases now I'm okay with apple moving off leather if this is what is part of their carbon neutral 2030 plan but making the fine woven case and positioning it as an actual quality option that's not going to fly here it reminds me this surface material like I have it where is it right here right this surface material reminds me of an alcantar material that you'll find in cars but find woven this doesn't age well we saw people who scratched it and left permanent marks that didn't go away I've just been using it in my pocket and taking it out about and I don't know if you can see in the light I think you can but it has permanent Marks here I mean what what the heck is that Ding from and it's 59 right look at this thing this is what a week or two I can't I can't buff that out like no I'm sorry this is not even remotely worth it like you can see the marks I have on it and they're not going away and I don't understand how this even passed any level of quality control and you know what's coming because fine woven is more like fine Whoa man that's a bad apple and it might arguably be the worst iPhone case that they have ever made and please remind me if there was a worse one because I can't recall that there was now on the flip side it does still make a cool DJ noise for parties hear that okay all right let's take a moment to thank the sponsor of this video bellroy bellroy puts its heart soul and countless design hours into helping the world carry with greater Simplicity and ease and they make real modern solutions for wallets cases and bags like these new iPhone 15 Pro cases now we've got three different bellroy cases here and all of them are made of ecotan leather and recycled Plastics that are mag safe compatible first up they're classic iPhone case it's as Sleek as the leather cases you can get and it also has a soft microfiber lining on the inside to protect your phone and if you want to bring more along with you you can check out the mod phone case plus wallet this is a magsafe compatible wallet accessory that holds up to three cards and snaps on it also has a notch here so that holds the wallet in place so it just won't slide around and is more secure than other magsafe wallets or if you want to keep things Sleek just remove it for your next outing but if you want it all together with a streamlined design then the phone case three card is the one for you it has integrated card storage that holds three cards that doubles as a wallet inside your iPhone 15 Pro case now the surface B Corp this Australian based company uses materials that are functional durable environmentally sustainable like ecotan leather recycled polyester microfiber and polymer made with recycled plastic so right now you can get 10 off anything on bellroy.com when you use this code on screen and you'll also find the link in the description of the video okay let's get back to the stories and let's talk iPhone 16 and 16 Pro too early well we've been talking about the 16 and 16 Pro for almost it feels like a year already so just wait for the 17 reports to start coming in a few months now a new report from Mac Rumors claims that they have obtained the preliminary weights and dimensions of the new planned iPhone 16 16 plus 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max and corroborates early reports that the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will have larger displays now the report says the standard 16 and 16 plus will keep the same dimensions as the current 15 and 15 plus that just came out a week ago with an increase in weight of about 2 grams for both models and the display sizes will stay the same at 6.1 and 6.7 inches now if we move on to the 16 pro and pro Max they are expected to increase their display size to 6.3 and 6.9 inches which is an increase in display by 0.2 inches for each model now that will increase the size of the 16 prone Pro Max as a whole and they will be slightly taller and wider according to the report they're expected still use the same titanium frame and finish as the 15 Pros but a new report says the entire iPhone 16 series is expected to get an additional capacitive button known internally as the capture button its codename Project Nova and will be one of the new selling points for the entire 16 lineup and it will be located on the same side as the power button which is opposite side of the action button on the current 15 pro and pro Max now it's also expected to be a capacitive button that activates by touch and pressure and will have that haptic feedback but it will not depress like a mechanical button does when pushed down so if we're looking forward to the entire 16 lineup based on reports and rumors all the phones are expected to get a new capacitive action button and also an all-new capacitive capture button and then on top of that the standard iPhone 16 lineup is expected to get a vertical camera Arrangement similar to the iPhone 12 for the standard models again this is all pre-production information and anything that change especially this far out and we saw things absolutely change from the first iPhone 15 rumors but as we got closer to launch um everything was pretty much locked in and aligned with the reports okay let's jump to some software updates and Mac OS Sonoma is now officially out you can check out my video on the Channel that I did earlier to Showcase all the new features it's not groundbreaking but I do love the new animated wallpapers that feel fresh and I'm using widgets plus so much more like the camera gestures those kind of creep up on me and then presentation mode that's there too so nice enhancements that won't fundamentally change how you use it but add-on Apple also released the newest iOS 17.1 and watch OS 10.1 for developers it brings the ability to favorite songs albums Artisan playlists in the iOS 17.1 music app and you can do it on the lock screen and it also helps improve recommendations and replaces the previous love system now airdrop transfers over cellular can now be completed a new feature Apple showcased at WWDC in this developer beta and then using watch OS 10.1 and iOS 17.1 you can now use the name drop feature from Apple watch to iPhone where you you bump them nearby you get them nearby and then you're allowed to exchange information now those are the big notable ones and there are a few other smaller tweaks as well but think about this we're hitting October and there have been rumors of a potential Apple event happening this year and it's happened before in the past but the latest report from Bloomberg's Mark German claims he does not expect Apple to hold one anymore and that the company doesn't have enough new products to justify it so you got new iPad and Mac launches not expected until 2024 and you know I had a feeling that Apple would hold out on a new iPad Pro until they really had something significant to bring to the table and you know I'm actually glad they aren't pushing through these minor incremental changes just because like I'm still on an M1 iPad Pro and I still felt no compelling reason to go for an M2 version but you know I can tell you that after what feels like um what a more incremental year and let's not forget that kovid shut down everything just what two years ago which really coincides with a significant window for development for new products I think 2024 is going to be an absolute Bonkers year for new products coming from Apple because you have the Apple Vision Pro coming early 2024 this is an all-new product for them an all-new platform for Apple that's going to be huge it's the Apple watch 10 year and apple isn't going to just do something incremental for that that's going to be a big deal all signs point to the iPhone sweet 16 being the next significant change for the lineup that moves things up a notch then the M3 coming in hot with all new Macs at every level and the iPad Pro and damn we might even see an all-new airpods Max which hasn't seen an update since late 2020 like trust me it's okay that you held on to your money in 2023 just be glad because 2024 is going to be huge for Apple and your wallet Andrew credit cards and then speaking of the Apple Vision Pro earlier I'm still just as excited about it even though it's still not a product that I can say you know hey y'all got to spend a minimum 3499 for it but it can get there for me with top tier immersive video experiences for movies and live sports and spatial video experiences like I can't wait to make my first Apple Vision Pro review video in spatial video that 10 people can see it's gonna be insane like I'm kind of kidding when I say that but I'm not but okay my good friend Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a recent interview with the independent that the Vision Pro is part of his nightly routine and he's convinced spatial Computing is part of the future and that's the thing for me like how good will this be as a computer can it be Beyond a media content consumption device for 3 500 I mean the experience is amazing but can I also wear a headset that long especially with its current weight and its comfort from my initial experience I can't say that I can yet but Cook's very high on it he should be because he's the CEO of Apple the technology is incredible I mean I'm really high on it but it still has a ways to go for the general consumer and that price is one of the biggest issues now meta they just announced their Quest 3 and it will be 500 and I don't even see people gonna buy these devices in droves let's this these are two totally different devices Apple Vision Pro to Quest 3 but they are competing in the same space um people buying those intros well look The Quest 2 was great but when was the last time you put on a quest 2 honestly think about it for some of us it might be close to six months nine months even a year or more than that like apple Vision Pro is different and we still haven't seen how it will perform with gaming yet I'm curious but Apple has been just planting all these seeds going in with gaming you got the a17 pro now and a future Focus for gaming that just keeps building and building in is really on the verge of exploding if AAA metal developers get on board or if Apple buys one to create top tier titles just for their platform and I really think that this is something that they want and need to do eventually eventually okay I could keep talking but I think I should stop now that's gonna do it for this week's video hey if you like what you see give me that thumbs up thumbs up and hit that notification Bell didn't get all my latest videos when they drop and if you want more of that Apple goodness you can check out my weekly apple bits XL audio podcast with the latest stories and special guests plus you can support all my content with an ad free version of the podcast Early Access to content and exclusive content at patreon.com Brian Tong thanks so much for watching take care and I'll see you on the next video because I still have a whole lot coming alright peace and love foreign"

Apple's major Executives so that I can give you everything you need to know the things I like and the things I don't like so let's start with the base 15 and 15 plus which have had three minor changes and three major ones from last year first being the design the iPhone 15s come in a whole Suite of pastely colors which are all pretty inoffensive I mean No One's Gonna Hate them but me personally I strongly prefer just proper vibrant confident colors as opposed to all this washed out off-white hoopla I remember seeing some rumors that there was going to be like a hot pink and a bubblegum blue and honestly that would have been awesome but what I am really glad about is these softer edges and the matte frosted finish on the back it may not be as cool as the very literal edginess on the last year's iPhones but I would take comfort any day you pick these phones up and instantly you notice this is like 200 more comfortable than the last phones and then the other minor but still very definitive Improvement is dynamic Island last year got it on the pro iPhones now we've got it on every iPhone and it doesn't fundamentally change the way you use your phone but I would say it's a combination of both a nicer aesthetic than the notch it just feels more futuristic and less like your phone's got a fringe they're the same picture with just a Sprinkle of nice to have features things like when you start a timer you can see the progress of that timer how when you order an Uber it'll tell you how many minutes till the Uber arrives funnily enough on my flight on the way here it was telling me the whole journey how much longer I had left to Landing time which is actually really convenient and the other perk of it is that it persists even when you move to other apps and so even though this Dynamic Island it isn't physically creating any new screen space it's the way that Apple has made the software around it that almost makes it behave like a secondary sub display within your main display that lets you do two things at once also the display itself is even brighter at up to 1600 nits or 2 000its if you're in direct sunlight if you haven't already used a 2000 display it's pretty staggering like it will not just be readable in broad daylight but actually bright there's a new Ultra wide bandship wideband being one of the ways that your iPhone communicates with your other Apple gadgets so the better chip basically means you can find your lost goods from further away and also your lost friends in case you're really bad at directions and it looks like the 15s are also getting a lot of the big camera upgrades of last year's top-end phones this is the first big change you know how Apple's used a 12 megapixel resolution main sensor for almost a decade now well it's gone in place of a bigger 48 megapixel sensor and thank goodness for that because yeah I mean Apple did Squeeze quite a lot out of the 12 megapixel sensor they had but it's only so far you can go and so with each of the last few Generations we really felt the pro iPhone stepping up and then the regular iPhones scraping together some very minor software improvements but clearly restrained by the limits of this week of Hardware so it's nice to see that limitation being lifted and also this 48 megapixel sensor has the side perk of letting you take two time zoom shots with far less of a quality hit than if we're still on the 12 minute pixel sensor and it means that in a lot of ways these base iPhone 15s are kind of like repackaged discounted versions of last year's 14 pros and that's not a bad thing if in one year what was previously Pro can become mainstream and that's progress and it does make this definitely feel like a bigger jump than what we saw last year between the 13 and the 14. although you are missing one key thing in the ultra fluid 120 hertz displays that the pros get these phones still have a standard 60hz refresh rate which feels slow to me because 120 hertz is what I'm used to but it may not bother you at all if that's what you're used to one more thing though and this is something I never really thought I wanted but now that I've seen it this is nearly as big of a deal to me as the actual camera upgrade itself when you shoot a photo with the 15 now your phone can capture depth information automatically which means you don't need to sit there and think what mode should I be in right now you just take the shot which means you can take the shot quicker and every single shot has the perk that afterwards you can go through and make it a portrait and even switch between the different focal points within that shot now I would guess that the reason they not done this sooner is that to do this your phone's got to capture a lot more information when it takes that photo and so it should take the phone longer and that would introduce some potential shutter lag and therefore blur in your shot this is going to need more testing on my end to see if Apple's managed to do it with no extra delay but that is what they're claiming but now it's time we talk about the elephant in the room the thing that the entire industry has been talking about for the last six months Apple has shifted from a lightning connector to a USBC or in other words they've shifted from a custom Apple made connector to the industry standard now it's not a secret that a big part of this is just Apple trying to get ahead of new EU rules which state that by 2024 all new smartphones need to be USBC to cut down on the unnecessary duplication of accessories and it might even be annoying in the short term if you have a bunch of accessories that are designed to work around lightning then they might well not work anymore but in the long term I think this is a pretty clear win on forefronts a it's better for the environment because from now on any smartphone accessory only needs to be made once and not in two separate versions it's about a customer experience because now you can get away with buying and carrying fewer cables as well as using whatever charger you want like I can actually feel the relief from the fact that when I now go places I can just take one power brick one cable and that will charge my MacBook my iPhone my Nintendo switch and even any Android whatever I'm carrying at the time this move is also going to reduce some of the force lock-in that people feel with Apple's ecosystem meaning that even if you use an iPhone you won't feel like you have to ditch every single accessory that you bought if you fancy trying an Android and then the final thing is that this is not just any USBC port at least on the pro iPhones this is a USB 3 Port which is not by any means unusual in the industry but it does mean that the transfer speeds are up to 10 gigabits per second which is a lot better it's like 20 times faster than lightning was what's not clear is if you're going to be able to get that maximum speed with the cable they ship you and also if you're going to be able to fully take advantage of it without using specifically made for iPhone accessories we'll find out it's quite funny because as they're announcing this I was just thinking to myself now it's just airpods left with a lightning connector and then they announced a set of airpods which also have USBC and I mean that is a pretty big ass to upgrade if you've just bought a lightning pair but it is good news if you've held off so far and then those airpods can be charged by your phone with the same cable that charges your phone which is good to have but it also feels pretty outdated given that most manufacturers can now wirelessly charge their earbuds and then the last big change for these base iPhones is the Chip And this is both kind of one of the biggest draws and one of the biggest drawbacks see every year up until 2022 when Apple's launched a set of phones all those phones were released with the same chip with potential slight modifications the A14 bionic the a15 bionic Etc but last year they started to separate the pros got the very latest a16 while the normal phones stuck with the same chip as the year before the a15 and so Wale is great that the base iPhones this year are getting an upgrade the normal 15s will now get the same a16 that the pros got last year and that it is let's be very clear a super fast chip that will not cause any performance problems what we're not getting is the very latest a17 that the 15 Pros have which basically means yeah this is a trend that we can just expect to see going forward that the pro phones will have not just better materials and better cameras and better display Tech but will also be the only way to actually get the latest internals too remember there's two ways to grow a company you can either increase the amount of customers which I'm sure apple is doing but it's a difficult Market to be doing that in or you can increase the average revenue per customer and I think this is what's happening with the iPhone right now I'm about to show you this in full force but the point is there has never been a bigger gap between Pro and non-pro as there is now with the iPhone 15s and the reason is to make it as much of a no-brainer as possible for a non-pro user to become a pro user because once you become a pro user once if you think about it you're going to stay a pro user you're going to keep buying the thousand dollar plus phones every time you upgrade and you're probably going to feel more bought into the ecosystem as a result like you might well think well I've already spent a grand on my phone I should probably get airpods Pro and if I get an iPad I should probably get the iPad Pro and ugh what's another ten dollars a month for some apple music too regardless of the strategy the iPhone 15 Pros pretty badass and for these there are six major things that we need to talk about the screen is using a brand new bit of tech that's allowed Apple to shrink the bezels to basically record-breaking levels to be clear some other phones do have Slimmer side bezels but from everything I've seen I don't think there's a phone that's achieved bezels like this while also having symmetry on all four sides and it's kind of a double win because anytime you manage to shrink the borders around your screen you get a choice you can either make the screen bigger and fit it into the same footprint or you can make your phone smaller with the same screen size which is exactly what Apple's done it's kind of like they've taken last year's iPhone 14 pro and just trimmed off the entire outer layer around the outside the phone is thicker than last generation though presumably to accommodate a bigger battery and so in a way it's actually really important that Apple's managed to do that trimming so that the phone doesn't feel bulky and then you've got the action button a button for which you can decide what it does which is something it seems like apple tested last year with the more Niche watch Ultra before now rolling out to the mainstream with the iPhone and my hot take is that I like it but I don't love it because I mean on one hand for me it's not taking away anything I never really used the ring silent switch because when I don't want to be disturbed by notifications I'd rather just go all the way into do not disturb and you can still use this action button to silence your phone but it's just that as well as that you can now also use it to open the camera to start a voice recording or what's really appealing to the hardcore Android customization freak inside of me is that you can also use it to trigger any of your Siri shortcuts which basically means any function of your phone so you could use it to open up Spotify you could use it to activate power saving mode which I could actually see myself doing quite a lot well you can even use it to vibrate your speakers at a specific frequency to clear out any water that's got into them my version of a good time but it's just there was also something nice about a slider that you could see what state it was in at a glance and that you can never accidentally trigger like you can with a button plus the key perk of an action button in my mind is that it is a faster more convenient way to trigger a command that you regularly use but one I'm holding my phone and I imagine when you're holding your phone my fingers are never all the way up here to be able to do that comfortably at that point it might actually be easier to just program multiple Taps of your power button to execute that same command I mean that is how I set up my iPhone 14 triple tap on the power button turns the screen grayscales but I do want to live with the action button first before I give any conclusive thoughts on it Apple has swapped materials on the pros from stainless steel to a titanium alloy now this is not the whole phone there's still the ceramic shield on the front and frosted glass on the back but what has changed is this enclosure in between and honestly titanium is great I mean it's even stronger than stainless steel which I mean I have dropped this phone probably six or seven times without a case directly on the floor each time I've had a mini heart attack and every time I've picked it up and been like no way there isn't a single permanent mark on the body so having something that's even stronger than that it's obviously a nice peace of mind but I think the thing that people will largely notice and appreciate more than that is the fact that titanium is also lighter the pro iPhone for a while now I've all been on the slightly too weighty for their size side so the reduced density that these bad boys have takes them to that really nice sweet spot where they still feel substantial like any pro phone should but without going so far that it's heavy it also means better thermal conduction out of the phone and we got these curved edges again ever since the day that Apple announced they were switching rounded sides for Sharp flat sides on their phones I've been counting down the days till they go back to having curves I mean it just makes sense your hand is not an angular object so neither should be the single device that you hold in your hand for the longest time so yeah I mean we took our time getting to this stage but boy am I glad we got here this phone feels amazing and it does so while not completely losing the core factor of having some sharpness to the design it's a bit of a shame that they didn't finish this all off with some more exciting unusual colors I mean a deep red wouldn't have hurt anyone but to be fair the silver this time is clean oh yeah there's a camera upgrade obviously there's a camera upgrade smartphones in 2023 so there's a slightly improved ultrawide camera and a big bigger sensor for the main camera which they're saying is going to make up to a two times difference to low light shots so we will definitely test that theory and also subtle little thing they only spent like three seconds in the event talking about it but they've also introduced a new coating to the camera which apparently reduces the amount of lens flares this is a top requested feature loads of people have asked for this but equally I don't think it has completely eliminated it based on my very quick testing 24 megapixels is now the Default Resolution output for the main camera which I know sounds a little underwhelming given that it is a 48 megapixel sensor but what's happened so far and what tends to happen with most companies who use high resolution cameras is that they take the shot at full resolution and then they down scale that resolution to have a cleaner but lower resolution output whereas this kind of makes it seem like apple is now confident enough in the image cleanliness already that they're no longer feeling like they need to reduce that resolution so much obviously Apple's example shots are very curated but they are showing levels of detail that the iPhone 14 in auto mode just could not do and then probably the biggest camera change is on the iPhone 14 pro Max only it's new telephoto lens we started off as a 2X it then became a 3X and now it is a five time zoom camera five is a lot of zoom and so I imagine the reason that we're not seeing this on the normal size Pro is space limitations and then they're pairing this new lens with better stabilization which is actually really important for higher magnifications because those lenses are much more prone to handshaking cool as it is though I do have some doubts like how there are other phones with 10 times optical zoom cameras which this probably won't outdo plus a big part of what makes Apple's portrait mode so great is that it uses the three-time zoom lens so you can sit further away from your subject and you get less distortion on their face but then if your only zoom camera is a five-time zoom camera there's probably too much magnification you'll most likely have to leave the room you're standing in to still fit them in the shot and so it seems like what they're going to do instead is to use the main 1X camera and to crop into that which kills the quality a little bit the only way you fix this problem is by having two Zoom cameras you have one high magnification Zoom when you want to properly get into something and then one much lower magnification one for the portraits last little camera tidbit is that the iPhone 15 Pros are going to be able to take spatial video basically 3D immersive video that you'll be able to properly watch and experience on an Apple Vision Pro headset it's very cool integration it's just not a cheap combo just before we get to pricing we've got to talk about one thing that I am really excited for and that is this a17 Pro chipset so keep because this is the first chip in the world to be based on a three nanometer process why is this a big deal well every other top engine in the world is based on a four nanometer process and basically the smaller that number the smaller the transistors that make up the chip if the transistors are smaller then they consume less power and you can have more of them and the cool thing about this is that proportionally speaking the jump between the four nanometer process and the three nanometer process is actually even bigger than the last major jump which was between five nanometer and four nanometer so basically you can expect a three nanometer chip to either run a lot faster if they use the extra space to cram in more transistors or Draw less power and produce less heat if they don't and it seems like based on Apple's stats that they're really pushing for the power efficiency angle which based on the iPhone 14s is exactly what I would have wanted them to do there's a pretty decent jump to the graphics power with support for Ray tracing and they did show some cool examples of console games that are making the jump to iPhone because of it which I'm all about but then beyond the examples that they showed I find it hard to believe that mass-market mobile game developers are actually going to get on board anytime soon and me can probably retrace games they also have a new Wi-Fi chip that'll let the pro phones connect to Wi-Fi 6E which if you have a 6E router is a big jump and a new 5G modem versus last year which should cut the power drain from connecting to mobile networks so yeah while the last iphone 14 series had good battery life it wasn't as good as the iPhone 13 series which really was chart topping but we will test this for ourselves so if you want to see that then a sub to the channel would be energizing then we've got the price this is the first year in a long time where we've had a price bump everything's the same except the pro Max which is now not just 100 more than the pro but 200. you do get more storage but this does put it very squarely up against other companies Ultra phones my first impression is that it probably does do enough to separate itself from the cheaper iPhones but that's what our detail tests are for see you there"

		"captions": "finally got the new iPhones iPhone 15 iPhone 15 plus iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now the color selection I have in here it was deliberate not necessarily my first choices but ones that I thought would be good to take a look at and compare first up we had to get one in the natural titanium this is a 15 Pro and natural titanium and it's actually a one terabyte version which is complete Overkill if you saw my how not to order an iPhone 15 video I think for most people one terabyte is kind of uh probably diminishing returns when you consider the cost but this was the only natural titanium I could get when I ordered it and I definitely wanted to show off a natural titanium so that's the spec on that one and by the way these like last I checked delivery times had slipped into October and for the pro Mac natural titanium into November so apparently this is a very hot color that people are interested in next up for the regular iPhone 15. now you guys remember from my how not to order the iPhone 15 video I said that for the standard 15 Baseline model I would personally be interested in the blue so that's what we have here they just call it blue it's like that very very light blue color so we'll check that out we've also got a yellow I was the most skeptical of I said I would not order the yellow for myself personally but because of that I wanted to get one for this unboxing video to see does it truly look as bad as I think it might I mean it is the palest Demis yellow that I don't even and then last is another interesting color the blue titanium a new color which kind of looked like the darker titanium colors in general like this one has a little bit of a blue tone to it so it could be interesting that gives us one of each model 15 Pro 15 regular 15 plus and of course 15 Pro Max unboxing experience similar these things have just continued to get more and more slender there's less and less inside the package and that's not exclusive to Apple that's for all smartphone brands that have now stopped including a ton of extras two little pull tabs this is extremely frustration free no blade even necessary here's our first Glimpse at the natural titanium okay for sure this phone got lighter I can just tell I handled this device often enough to know that you know it feels lighter in the hand we have the brushed titanium look it's already Gathering some fingerprints there apparently this is more of an issue on the darker colors we'll do our testing over there as well but yeah you're gonna tarnish it a little bit it's titanium hopefully Mo can pick that up there it does gather fingerprints immediately on the titanium frame but titanium is such a cool material when they say natural titanium it kind of messed with your mind a little bit or at least it did for me because sometimes I'm ordering clothes like a natural hoodie or something and it actually has like a beige tone to it when you think of natural but they're just meaning here like this is the color of titanium it looks like a brushed kind of Steel color so camera module cut out power switch over here volume up and down and then obviously the new action button look at this this is so strange to see on an iPhone for the first time USBC on the bottom of the device no more lightning connector we've also got speakers in that location as well inside the package not a ton I think we're going to get some stickers a white Apple sticker not a natural titanium sticker a Sim tool a little bit more paperwork and then a braided USBC to C cable it's white it's not any type of like special color to go with the natural titanium no more power adapter included in the box and you might be thinking about what your options are for that our partners at anchor have plenty of solutions for you including this little guy this is a 20 watt power brick which is the same size as Apple's existing 5 watt power brick look at this they're I mean basically the same size either is pocketable and one is 20 and the other is five now Apple also sells their very own 20 watt adapter but that gets quite a bit larger and actually more expensive than anker's variant but Anker has a bunch of other products too including their very own high powered type c cables to match the aesthetic and then there's some new power Banks they just put out also this nano power bank is capable of 30 watt recharge I like the fact that you can kind of hang this one you've also got a USB a and another USBC there's another little power bank option here which plugs in just like this sits on the bottom 22.5 watt capable nano power bank USBC connection for iPhone now and not just Android devices you can use this for all your different devices including your other iOS devices that were already on USBC now what about when you're at home or traveling maybe on the desktop or even on the bedside table check out how slim this little power cable is power strip they've actually designed it so that the receptacle extends to receive the entirety of the power brick USBC USB a another usba and then one more type c so lots of Versatility here this is called the six in One charging station and it's 67 watt capable now I know most people have moved on from this 5 watt brick but there's still out there I still see people recharging their modern smartphone with a USB a 5 watt Apple power brake believe it or not if you are committed to this form factor and you want something extremely small then that's where the Nano Pro comes in you can have that but still get the 20 watts that your device can take advantage of so what we'll do is unbox two of these phones we'll plug one into the 5 watt adapter and one into the 20 watt adapter just to Showcase how big of a difference that is you can go check the description for pricing you're also going to save money on this right now to go with your new iPhone so go click those links and pick up a nano Pro from Anker for faster charging in a similar little form factor all right next up let's reach for the iPhone 15 blue and this is actually the base model and so therefore it is the most affordable iPhone 15 at the moment I'm having a hard time figuring out what to recommend to people I was actually just having a conversation with the viewer of the channel randomly in public that's even lighter than I thought it was going to be and he said what should I get should I get the iPhone 15 what do you think do I need the pro and then he was going over his finances with me and I was like well hard to say these are all expensive of devices I think bang for your buck for somebody in that boat for somebody who is concerned about the upgrade costs coming from a much older iPhone very reluctant to upgrade probably the 15 is sufficient the other thing I should mention speaking of light weight these have gotten a lot closer now because of the titanium aspect the titanium construction on the pro model the blue is more prominent in the frame rather than the actual back plate really dims the bluishness and instead it almost looks white I don't mind it it's just extremely light keep that in mind so in the hand we're talking about an extremely comparable user experience we've got USBC joining the party on the standard iPhone 15 as well we've got a slightly different placement for the SIM tray we have our separate volume buttons and no action button instead you maintain your switch which I don't know for some people that might be a preference they may prefer the existing switch we've got our power switch over on the other side and the camera hump not as significant still got plenty of wobble there slightly less maybe do we have blue stickers nope just going to get a white sticker they simplified all right next up we have the controversial yellow I believe in my last iphone 15 video I think I referred to this as urine colored iPhone yellow I don't know gotta wait and see things can sometimes appear differently I wasn't the only one a lot of people were saying hey these colors are extremely subdued this year nothing is very vibrant kind of pale yeah hahaha that is a weird that is weird like how you have I don't know if this is showing up for you Mo but there's nothing pleasing about this color to me at all it's a barely there yellow a reasonably hydrated urine which increases in its Amber tone when you get to the camera I don't know who wants this color the frame I don't mind it's kind of more of like a light gold but like the actual phone itself that is a a rather odd Choice from Apple the same otherwise compared to the non-plus model we've still got our USBC here we've got our switch which remains intact obviously battery sizes display sizes are going to be different if you guys are curious about the e-sim thing here in Canada we're still having the SIM tray even though these devices are simultaneously esim compatible or capable however in some markets they could be esim only so this is the granddaddy the pro Max and this is in blue titanium and it is the base model 256 storage base for the Promax the base for the standard phone is 128. I think this is a beautiful color this is a very nice color this one is better in real life than in the images it is a very very deep blue almost towards black with the mirrored blue finish up in the camera section here and the matte finish everywhere else from a fingerprint perspective also a bit of a magnet because of that titanium aspect I don't know for me my initial reaction is so what it's titanium that's so cool like a titanium phone like just the attributes of titanium are so cool and lighter definitely which makes a bigger difference on a bigger phone you know if you were sort of borderline if you wanted a Max device now it's a little bit lighter it's a little bit less of a brick in my pocket pretty cool so check this out these are now set up and the first thing that you are prompted by on the pro and pro Max model is to configure your action button press and hold to turn silent mode on and off you can also customize the action button to open camera turn on flashlight or access a favorite iPhone feature okay so let me click customize we'll see what some of the options are silent mode yeah we know about that Focus so do not disturb that's nice straight into the camera flashlight voice memo magnifier a shortcut to an app for now for the purpose of demonstration we'll do flashlight here we go that's a that's an action button flashlight press and hold it's off press and hold it's on press and hold its off I can see this being useful I mean look I like buttons I like switches I like versatility I like the fact that it doesn't have to be something by default but instead it's encouraging you to configure it and they even built that little initial interface in order to encourage you to do so this display is bright that is a very nice looking display on the pro Max let's boost the brightness on the standard Pro also extremely bright let's do a quick display comparison while we're here yeah more pop on the pro have you not seen that yet what was it you haven't seen this yet no no you don't blow on it you just tap them like that to exchange contacts nearby share have you seen that before yeah it's subtle but this display is a slight step slight Step Above let's go to the regular 15. this display looks better than the regular Pro it looks better than the plus it looks better than the standard iPhone 15 subtle they all look good so let's test the speakers let's start with regular iPhone 15 audio test full volume [Music] foreign 15 plus [Music] iPhone 15. [Music] 15 plus [Music] the plus has more bass yeah let's go to the pro [Music] foreign [Music] I would say and then last up Pro Max which should sound the best [Music] [Music] take away here the bigger phones just sound better there's obviously subtle differences beyond that I don't know maybe maybe the 15 plus might sound the best but it's very similar they're close cameras okay let's bring over our favorite plant within the pro lineup the max model gives you the advantage of having more reach on the zoom lens what that means for you is five times Optical I'll go in order of short to Long here is 0.5 x followed by 1X which they're calling 24 millimeter 2x which they don't bother representing in millimeter form and then 5X damn that 5x is nice very beautiful bokeh like in the background so this is exclusive to the pro Max model if you really want that extra reach and this is where you're going to be looking if I load up the standard pro model the layout is identical except in this situation the furthest reaches 3x so 0.5 1 two and three so to get an idea of the difference in reach that's what 3x is going to give you that's what 5x is going to give you so quite different but I don't know at a sporting event or something you could take advantage of 5x a concert I don't need to tell you these these cameras are great performers and now we have this new 5x Zoom which is one of the better Optical zooms I've seen Now we move over to the standard iPhone 15. our options once again are different we go from 0.5 to 1 and then to 2X and we end there it's kind of funny you go up the the list here and you get closer and closer the more money you spend the closer you get to your subject standard model 0.5 one two they all look great we're talking about cameras on smartphones in 2023 they do all have Dynamic Island it's a tried and true form there's people watching this video that are sitting there saying it's not different enough I agree like it's there's nothing shocking about it it's iterative I said this in previous videos hey you put a little button over here you throw an action button on there you're changing material to Titanium how big of a deal is that to the general public most of the conversations I'm having in public it's not that big of a deal you asked Tim Cook he'll be telling you these are the best iPhones we've ever made as they should be they're the most recent version but how much better than the previous version for me this this is going to sound crazy but for me the most compelling new feature is USBC and that's kind of sad it just took too long oh but seriously like I just hated having to have separate cables even separate cables within Apple's ecosystem I was ready for that to be done and now that we have type c here this feels to me like a modern 2023 device the other thing I should mention one of my favorite aspects of iPhones in general is the video modes these are some of the best video Shooters out there period it has an incredibly smooth and pleasing smartphone video capability 4K here 4K 60. look at the bokeh look at the Focus fall off look at the 60 frames look at the smoothness and I'm gonna move around this plant look how smooth this camera move is and of course the audio that you're hearing is coming via the microphones on the device as well so you get a sense for the performance there and I will do my usual and approach Mo in an uncomfortable way so that you can see how it focuses on a human face but then I'll hold it longer than I should oh no so then he gets more uncomfortable and we get a we get the retention Spike that we're looking for okay the camera's really good look man like the camera is really good the camera's really good because I've been shooting videos for so long I had a video camera back in the day before anybody had video cameras like before smartphones even shot video think about that for a second couple of gray hairs in the beard over here the fact that we can shoot that caliber of video on this little guy is just a bit ridiculous honestly how different is it going to be if I'm saving some cash and grabbing the iPhone 15 regular 4K 60. iPhone 15 regular test smooth 1X audio coming through the microphone spin tomorrow is it 4K oh it's 4K okay okay that looks great as well man for for the average person it looks great as well this one's Gathering more fingerprints by the way as I'm using it you know what these fingerprints don't matter to me because I know I'm gonna slap a later case on here anyways just like that boom and just like that my titanium is mostly protected and covered and I'll just be holding on to this beautiful Kevlar instead without adding a tremendous amount of weight or bulk and yes we are taking orders for 15 pro pro Max 15 regular 15 plus so head over to the link in the description if you want to pick up a later case for yourself this is for people who want the absolute thinnest case possible extremely satisfying texture and extremely easy on and off capabilities satisfying in every way so how much are you really missing out on if you're still letting this live watt power adapter kick around well you're missing out on like over an hour's worth of savings recharging your device and we actually stacked the deck against anchors 20 watt in this case by having it recharge the bigger Pro Max model which obviously has a bigger battery to charge versus the 5 watt which only had to recharge the regular Pro 15 Pro so the pro Max charging off of the 20 watt nanopro power adapter that's two hours and 20 minutes from dead complete dead zero all the way to a hundred percent and the old school 5 watt power adapter took three hours and 40 minutes to charge up the iPhone 15 Pro from zero Dead all the way to full It's Time to Say Goodbye to these little units and replace them with far better units like the this one 20 watts versus 5 Watts it's an absolute no-brainer all right so there you have it iPhone 15 15 Pro 15 plus 15 Pro Max is it a revolutionary iPhone not really I told you my favorite feature is kind of a mundane one which is just USB type-c I like the material I like this idea of titanium I do like having this configurable action button I love the fact that Apple left it configurable I think my optimal device out of the bunch is probably the 15 Pro regular size I also think the 15 is probably a good value for a lot of people comparatively if you're in the Apple ecosystem if you're sticking with iPhone I don't think you have to have the pro model the standard model has gotten really good yes you're giving up some features and functionality but for a lot of people I talk to in public this thing is going to be a huge upgrade over what they currently have in their pocket the fit and finish is really nice it's well put together the colors leave something to be desired they're not super Punchy they're more subdued this year but who knows maybe some people will prefer that let me know down in the comments which model you're most interested in if you're gonna buy one at all or if there's some other smartphone that you have your eye on also make sure to go support our sponsors anchor and also of course later case if you want to slap an incredibly slim case on your brand new iPhone 15 15 Pro 15 Pro Max 15 plus or other smartphone thank you very much for your time foreign"

		"captions": "these are the iPhone 15s Apple talked about how they're the most power efficient phones ever including one claim that said they were up to three times more power efficient than their competitors but what they didn't mention is what that means for battery life so we're gonna go through a normal day of use to see how these new iPhones Stack Up and while that happens there's a few things about the batteries here that we need to talk about so first thing in the morning some breakfast tiktok disappointed in myself and let's just quickly go over what phones we're testing here so first the four new iPhones the 15 Pro Max which is now 11.99 the 9.99 15 Pro the 8.99 iPhone 15 plus and then the 799 base iPhone 15 and then as well as seeing how these new phones stack up against each other we're also going to be able to get a really cool bit of perspective because we have the iPhone 14 pro Max to see how the very best phone from this year will compare to the best phone from last year we have the base 14 to see how the base iPhones have changed from year to year and then of course the 13 Pro Max simply because that phone is the current world champion on the missed who's the boss battery test rankings so it's just there in case we break the record all right breakfast over and at this point I'll normally start getting ready for the day with my favorite Spotify playlist and this is quite an exciting result so far because the 15 Pro Max is in first place and it's trading blows with the current King the 13 Pro Max I would say that I care more about the battery on these iPhone 15s than I have on any other iPhone I've tested before for the simple fact that this is the first time that it's not just about you thanks to the long overdue USBC Port which cannot just receive but give power you can for the first time on an iPhone use any extra juice that you might have to charge your earphones to charge your watch or just other people's phones which means that it's not really the case anymore that as soon as you get a day's worth of battery that's plenty I'll take every drop I can get okay so we are two hours in now probably time to do some work so this is chat gbt4 it's the most current version of chat gbt let's ask it to do our work for us if you haven't played around with gbt4 by the way very fun tool like just as a joke I'm asking it right now to give a hundred reasons why cats are better than dogs and it's doing it so looking at the current percentages what's very exciting here is that the 15 Pro Max is just now ever so slightly edging out every single other phone on this test what's not as exciting is that the smaller Pro is in last place we're gonna dig into this in a minute because I have a theory but for now time for a zoo meeting with myself seven times yeah I normally sit next to these phones whenever we're battery testing just making notes and nursing them like children okay so why would the iPhone 15 Pro be performing worse than the iPhone 15 and more concerningly the iPhone 14. well firstly against the iPhone 15 I think part of it is just that Apple has made the iPhone 15s better for battery life and based on the spec sheet you actually have this weird situation where it seems like the base 15 also has a bigger battery capacity than the 15 Pro the thing that the pro has going for it is the pro motion display which has the ability to increase the phone's refresh rate all the way up to 120 hertz but importantly for battery to dial it all the way down to 10 Hertz when the app you're in doesn't need to be refreshing constantly but because in this test so far every app we've been in has had some sort of significant movement happening on screen at all times we haven't been able to reap the benefits of that but expect that to change as we go on okay after a two hour call with seven errands I need a break so let's open up the headspace meditation app and I want to explain another factor that I think is affecting the 15 Pros well obviously one thing is dynamic Island the 14 and the 13 Pro Max they don't have to worry about it I'd imagine it's not a massive battery drain but at the same time I'd be very surprised if it isn't contributing to at least some of the difference here because it's essentially one extra process that has to be running in the background at all times but what I think is the bigger thing is that the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max specifically are being powered by a brand new chipset the a17 pro the fact that it's a next generation three nanometer chip should mean pretty large power efficiency improvements that's the impression that I got when I watched the event especially since Apple explicitly mentioned that the iPhone 15 Pros had the most efficient CPU ever and that the efficiency cores in the chip which run when you're not doing anything particularly demanding are three times more efficient than the competition but then clearly in practice the battery gain is not as much as we initially thought it would be just because a lot of the extra Headroom generated by the efficiency is erased by the push to get more performance out of the chip now let's just quickly move on to cameras which is where I spend a lot of my time recording now this hits to power efficiency is not my ideal like I was saying earlier that with these phones in particular I want that battery but what does make me feel slightly better about this is that it looks like the battery life of the 15 series is still looking better than the battery life of the 14 series the 15 Pro Max is beating the 14 pro Max and the 13 Pro Max mind you and then the base 15 is absolutely destroying the base 14. and also just the fact that for the first time it looks like Apple's making a big push to try and create this exclusive lineup of console games that will also play on these iPhone 15 Pros there's only four games that have been officially promised so far but if that gets delivered on in a big way then that would be one of the few things that would make me okay with them prioritizing the bumping Graphics power instead of pushing for endurance from the last generation I suppose the other thing to bear in mind as we move on to YouTube which is usually where our content ends up after we film is that while it's easy to get caught up in the chips and how much they're improving from an efficiency standpoint the biggest effect on your battery life is going to be your screen and while display Tech is improving it just doesn't feel like it's improving quick enough to make a tangible difference between these Generations Okay so winding down the day now with some gaming but do you notice something very interesting that's kind of been happening under our eyes with these batteries we spent so much time talking about the pros that we've completely neglected the 15 plus which is now squarely in first place this is an impeccable performance ah I'm kind of torn about it though it's hard to be mad about crazy battery life but then at the same time if you're someone who's paid extra to have the pro experience is battery not part of that I'd consider myself a pro user and for me battery life is so vital that if a company came on stage one year with their phones and they just said we've made the battery last 30 longer they could drop the mic they could do nothing else and just walk off at that point and that would genuinely be enough for me to say that it was a success okay we've had our first casualty and we are about to have our second bear in mind that for this test Wi-Fi is on Bluetooth is on and the screen brightness is pretty high the phone speakers are off so obviously the exact amount of battery life that you get will vary but I've tried to calibrate it in a way that's more similar to a normal day in the life as opposed battery tests which have been on the heavier use side I can't believe how long this has been going on for I am genuinely exhausted but what makes me feel slightly better is that when I do hit the hay I can do so with my eight sleep pod after a pretty long trip to America it has a cover that fits over your bed like any fitted she eats and what you're seeing on these phones is the app that comes with it the key perk being it's temperature controlled it's set to my perfect temperature so I don't need to worry about having a loud fan next to my face and then as you go through the night it'll automatically adjust this temperature to make sure that your body hits all the important sleep stages and then it also tracks your sleep and gives you detailed stats about how you slept and how you can improve like this is mine from yesterday let's not dwell on that it shows me how much deep sleep I had and at what point I was awake and if you prefer a cooler temperature but you have a partner who likes to sleep on a stove you can set each side to different temperatures it's expensive but there's few things more worth investing in than your sleep I bought this myself a few years ago and genuinely to date it's been one of the best purchases I've ever made so I'll leave a link in the description and if you use the code boss you will get an extra 200 off okay time for the results so the iPhone 14 is in last place with 9 hours and two minutes it goes without saying that this is not bad battery life it's far more than you get on something like the iPhone SE and is enough for I would still say 80 of phone users then you've got the iPhone 15 Pro which did not last as long as I hoped and I expected it would likely the combination of a more power-hungry chip without the bigger battery capacity of the 15 Pro Max but equally I have been using this phone alongside a 14 pro and I found it consistently a little better which is to say it's plenty for most people but it's not the phone if you're a big power user it's almost quite funny then to see that next lasting over half an hour longer is the base iPhone 15. what do you think to this I mean it's obviously really good battery life for a base iPhone maybe the best ever but am I the only one who feels like if there's one thing that the pros should have over the base versions that it is battery next up then lasting basically an hour longer is the iPhone 14 pro Max I've used an iPhone 14 pro Max for the last year as my main phone and it's been I would say enough for my high powered needs almost all the time there's definitely been a couple of occasions where if it just lasted that extra five percent longer I could have made a phone call that I really needed to or got one more round of a game in before needing to charge but generally speaking I've had a good experience and then the 13 Pro Max which honestly has not once caused me problems I'm not surprised to see it in front of the 14 pro Max since that also reflects my day-to-day experience with the phone what that means though is that yes the 15 Pro Max is the best performing Max phone so far this is an extremely strong run that it's had and the result makes sense I mean the battery capacity on this Pro Max is a full 35 bigger than on the smaller Pro so the fact that it lasts 25 longer not a shocker and hey there's a little sprinkle on top I did also realize I left my Sim in this phone for the first few hours of this test which will make very minimal difference when on Wi-Fi but just for the sake of clarity it probably would have lasted an extra five minutes and then what I did not see coming the winner of this entire test and by far the longest score I've ever recorded slash had to sit through would be the 15 plus and do consider subscribing if you appreciate the effort this is actually such a lead over not just the phones that finished early but also the pro Max's for about 10 minutes after this test finished I was unironically just sitting there contemplating putting the 15 Pro Max in a drawer and switching to this this is absolutely absurd battery life and I am all for it"

		"captions": "if you zoom out to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max I think it's fair to say that these are a fairly forgettable set of phones there is no one big defining feature that puts them on the map like the dynamic Island was on the iPhone 14 Pros or the 120 hertz Pro motion displays on the iPhone 13 Pros the famous summary page that Apple makes for each of their new products for this phone half of it was filled with features that were already well used to there's not even a bold new color to aesthetically differentiate itself this is the single driest selection in recent memory for me but it's only now that I've started Living with it that I've realized so many little things things that are easy to miss things that Apple didn't even mention that all add up to make this a more surprising more immediately beneficial experience than I would say I've had with any iPhone I've tested before this especially when it comes to cameras in case you're wondering by the way this is what you get when you order a 15 Pro it's fairly standard Apple fare no longer a black box that you used to get with Pros I imagine to use less ink inside you get the phone the new USBC cable and the little insert which has your sim ejector tool manual and a couple of Apple stickers now this cable is a bit of an upgrade with this woven fiber around it which is going to make it more durable and is very very resistant to tangling but just know that it isn't a fast cable the iPhone 15 Pros are capable of USB 3 speeds I.E 20 times faster than lightning used to be but with the default cable you will not get them this is pretty standard for most phones though okay so the first thing about these phones which I guess I didn't realize the full potential of until switching to the pro Max is the action button this brand new programmable button that sits in place of the Ring silent switch that you can set to whatever trigger you want and my heart take when I first saw this was well you can already program things to a triple tap of your power button why bother doing the same thing to a button that's just much harder to reach and the hard to reach part that hasn't changed it still makes no sense to me why a button designed around being a shortcut is so far out of the radius of where your fingers can reach in a normal grip unless you use it for the camera I would say that 80 of photos that I take on my phone I do so in landscape mode and and that works really well with the action button because when you go like this your finger is naturally resting on it the button is designed so that you have to hold for half a second or so to activate I guess to reduce accidental presses and then that activation can take you immediately to not just the camera but exactly the camera mode that you want to be the default and then if you do that the action button will also double as your shutter button when you get there which means this is now the fastest way to be able to quickly record a clip when the opportunity unexpectedly arises it's not perfect because let's say If instead of here the button was actually up here that would mean that you could properly grip the phone without worrying that you're actually covering the thing that's shooting the photos plus you might find that for a lot of commands it's actually much easier to map them to the power button or even the backtab feature which every iPhone has but the point is action button solid new feature has its uses and also something Apple didn't really mention but just kind of showed as part of one of their slides was that the iPhone 15 Pros are coming with a new thread radio which may well make them better at communicating with other Apple Smart Home devices so I have no doubt that people will find cool ways to use this action button to even control the home okay this is a phone let's talk about call Quality we don't talk about call Quality very much mostly because it doesn't tend to change between Generations but there is a really cool new Improvement here to voice isolation so I've got my fiance drisha on the line right now she's using a 15 Pro and it sounds terrible yeah okay so let's try the voice isolation [Music] without any noise it literally feels like you've turned the tap off that's crazy there's a lot and while the voice isolation won't improve the quality of your speech it will pretty much erase all background noise without reducing it and then just like the new FaceTime video effects what's quite cool is that these voice effects because they're happening on a hardware level they persist whatever the software you're using whether it's a normal call a FaceTime call or a zoom call what I would love is to be able to get this working with Voice Notes too because I mean clearly it can and that is like my main form of communication nowadays okay the phone also surprised me when it comes to Performance naturally being the nerd that I am one of the first things I did was Run The geekbench Benchmark the CPU in this new a17 Pro chip is coming out about 10 faster and the graphic score is up by 20 from last year which is solid and in a way a bit surreal because it's actually approaching the graphics performance of the M2 powered MacBooks but then at the same time if we zoom out and look at what's happening in the General market these are not out of the ordinary generational leaps in power but what was genuinely surprising is that after a long time it finally feels that we have something to do with that power what you're seeing right now is Resident Evil Village playing on an iPhone and we've seen plenty of pretty phone games before like Genji impact but what is crazy about this is that this is not Resident Evil Village mobile this is Resident Evil the same Resident Evil that you've seen on consoles all the assets and the textures are taken straight from the PlayStation 4 version of the game and then it's pairing that with some of the tech from the PS5 version of the game like HDR which is a much higher brightness range than last gen consoles could support now as someone who has played this game on current gen consoles holding it in my hand not even on one of those bulky handheld PCS with a battery life of two hours on a smartphone is very impressive it is only running at 720p resolution as opposed to the 900p that the PlayStation 4 runs the game at but still the fact that it is the same game that runs on a box like this or a box like this on your phone that fits in your pocket and also includes the display the surround sound speakers and everything else built in it has definitely felt like one of those feet of Technology moments excuse the the dazzling so many times when I'm away somewhere the only Gadget I have with me is my phone and I just wish that I could have some proper meaty offline single player games that I could sink my teeth into so if this whole console gaming on a phone thing actually catches on now I'm gonna be a very happy guy and you probably won't see many Tech videos but we don't know if it will yet there's only four console games like this currently announced exclusively for the pro iPhone 15s one of them is the latest Assassin's Creed which is very cool and surreal because that game looks like this but one of the games that I spent growing up with on my PlayStation Portable was also Assassin's Creed and that looked like this but it does raise questions like how easy is it to Port over a PlayStation 4 game to an iPhone how many will come after this initial honeymoon period and will they also come to Android phones later on because powerful as this is the graphics performance on the iPhone is not dissimilar to what you get on the latest Samsung we have no idea there is also support for Wi-Fi 6E base into that package which is basically a less congested version of Wi-Fi 6 but does need a router specifically with that technology in mind okay let's talk about the design right now where we are with the iPhone 15 Pros High Point we've just come from a set of phones that were pretty yes but very heavy and not comfy to a set of phones that are just as pretty but more comfortable thanks to the new contoured edges much lighter thanks to the material swap to Titanium not to mention more practical thanks to having a matte finish all the way around with the iPhone 14 pro that I used to use the fingerprinty stainless steel sides the couple of marks I've got near my charging port from where I've well missed and the dust in the mute slider are the only giveaways that this is a well used phone but with these I mean obviously we'll need about three months to say anything conclusively but it feels like the combination of having both matte and brushed side rails should help to hide that it's not the dream though because even though the material does hide scratches better it does look like it can be scratched easier and also fingerprints on these darker phones tend to show up as a light area which means that around your buttons you tend to almost get this haloing effect from past fingerprints that you struggle to wipe away they're not permanent marks they'll come off straight away if you go in there with a cloth but you can't be doing that every day so you will notice it from time to time zooming out a little I still think the most comfortable shape that a phone can be is pebble-like I've asked my whole family and every person agreed that the iPhone 11 Pro is more comfy to hold and use than the 15 Pro but then I suppose that thing has its own set of issues because the curved nature of the phone introduces a bulge around the screen and that's actually something the new phones do especially well the bezels are really really Slim So it's one of those things that of course you will get used to the same way you get used to the acceleration of a new car or the sound quality of a great audio system but then anytime you get a hint of perspective like seeing anyone else's older iPhone it does make you reappreciate what I think is a bit of a design feat okay so I mentioned that cameras are something pretty special on these phones and let's be very clear about something what makes these cameras special is no one thing in isolation it's not about the ultroid camera that lets in a bit more light it's not about the new coating that helps reduce the amount of lens flares on this lens because honestly you still get enough lens flares on the main camera to account for both it's not any of these pieces on their own but it's how the whole thing works together as a system that's even better than the sum of its parts and this is the thing that I've only now realized having used the phones so for starters the iPhone 15 Pros take 24 megapixel photos again that doesn't sound very impressive when you think that the latest Samsung can take up 200 megapixel shot but it's the fact that the iPhone can do this 24 megapixel by default that's the key thing that it takes 24 megapixel in in auto mode with no perceptible compromise that I can see not in terms of the time taken to capture not in terms of the dynamic range of the image not in terms of the amount of post-processing that happens afterwards it's actually faster here to take a 24 megapixel shot than it is for most phones to take a 12 megapixel shot which is the industry standard default even four phones which have 200 megapixel camera sensors so that's one part of it but then you've got the file format most phones when they take photos they output those photos as JPEG images for quite a few years though the iPhone instead uses a file format called Heat which is really similar to JPEG and image quality but with smaller file sizes actually about half the size now that the resolution of the photos has gone up though the image size has gone up with it but even though the resolution has doubled the image size has only gone up one point five times which leaves you with this bizarre situation where the 24 megapixel shots taken here take up less space than the 12 megapixel shots on other phones oh and that smaller file now also includes both the portrait mode data and the live photo data at the same time this is kind of where it really started to click with me because I think like motion photos in general are an amazing feature I was making a little video for drisher and I's anniversary recently and the only way that video was possible was because for every photo I take an obvious the phone was also storing the entire scene just before that shot was captured and so long as you're doing that it is super quick to then save that motion as its own video which you can put into a longer project then I also love portrait mode every single time I'm trying to take a nice photo for someone else I will take like three normal shots and then I'll take a separate set of three portrait shots to let them decide which one they prefer because they're almost two very different propositions the normal shot is very practical and utilitarian and then the portrait shot is very cinematic all of that extra time all of that faff and all about having to think is just gone because you don't need to be in portrait mode to take portraits you just take the photo as you always do and as soon as a person a dog or a cat appears in the image this little F will pop up when that F pops up you know that you are automatically capturing depth information and that you can go back into the shot after you've taken it to tweak the level of portrait mode you want to apply again in 24 megapixels so double the resolution that portrait mode used to be the F will also come up if you ever tap to focus because then the phone knows that you're trying to focus on something in particular which means that even if you miss focus on that subject in the moment you can go back in afterwards and tweak it and so what I'm really getting to here is that Apple has managed to build with the iPhone 15 Pros a camera system for which all you have to think about is just this one thing is it framed the way that I want it to be the rest is done for you as well as now photonic engine this was introduced last year as a level of processing applied to each image to add in extra detail and fix up the colors but when it was announced it wasn't for all camera modes for things like portraits and night mode which already required a lot of processing that wasn't Headroom to also have the photonic engine going on not anymore it now works in portrait mode it works in night mode it works on the front camera and it works on every single magnification of the rear camera and you can really tell the difference like I went out a couple of days ago to get some shots of the night sky and while sometimes between iPhone Generations you do struggle to notice the difference the improvements here are at a glance instantly recognizable and the other thing that they've addressed is HDR HDR in photos is one of Apple's historic long-running weaknesses I think it originates from the fact that Apple doesn't want to over process images but the truth is in a lot of cases like when you have really harsh backlighting behind you you kind of have to well it's better here I wouldn't say that Apple's completely solved all instances of parts of the image being Overexposed but at the same time I didn't expect a difference this noticeable versus last year's phone you can tell on the rear camera and you can also tell on the front camera so do you kind of see what I'm saying about these cameras this idea that no individual aspect is particularly groundbreaking or new it's just the fact that it all comes together in the highest quality lowest hassle way that I've ever seen with by the way the smoothest operating version of the camera app that I've ever seen on a phone or within like a three megabyte file now is how Apple's trying to pitch this thing as seven lenses in your pocket there's some truth to it but you can't really take that statement at face value see the way it works is the iPhone 15 Pros have a 48 megapixel main camera sensor if you tap on this one time zoom it'll cycle between three different focal lengths between 1X and 1.5 x now because the camera is 48 megapixel and you're outputting images in 24 megapixel you can between 1X and 1.5 x Zoom use different amounts of this full sensor to achieve a result that is still genuinely a 24 megapixel shot and so on the bright side when you take let's say a 35 millimeter photo it is more detailed than if you just took a 1x shot and zoomed in till it looked like a 35 millimeter photo but then the downside is that when you do this you're not using the full extent of your sensor and therefore the image quality isn't as high I wouldn't say the degradation is noticeable but it will be there and it's just a bit icky to call this a 7 lens system when really if you're going to do that you could just add a stop at every single possible different magnification and then call it a thousand camera system as a feature it's fine it does the job but unlike the way it's being presented it is not the same as actually having seven lenses right now let's talk about the new zoom camera so for the iPhone 15 Pro Max only the three times optical zoom lens camera has become a five times optical zoom lens camera and this is a bigger upgrade than it initially seems they've not just taken the zoom camera that was already on the pro and stuck a bigger lens on it the pro Max has a larger sensor and better stabilization than the regular Pro too and let's be very clear even though five times Zoom is not the highest magnification we've ever seen on a phone by a long shot this is still a very good quality five-time zoom camera which means that in most lighting conditions the shots look pretty good even at 10x and the lens has so much natural foreground background separation that oftentimes you don't even need to rely on portrait mode for that DSLR like separation and check this this is a one-time Zoom portrait taken on the 15 Pro Max notice how much Distortion there is on my face taking a portrait at 3x is far more flattering because you get to be further away and then 5X fsos slightly even more flattering than a 3X so it has a purpose and it's just a fun tool to have because 5x feels like such a distinct image to what a one x image looks like and you don't have to step back as much as I was expecting to fit the person that you're trying to shoot in the frame but it is still very much a trade see the way the main camera sensor on this phone works you can only get so-called lossless zoom in between 1X and 2x and so the entire gap between your 2X and your 5x Zoom range now that relies on pure digital Zoom which is why in these shots the 3x image while fluttering is definitely the weakest quality and as you get to like 4.9 x like just before the 5x optical zoom camera kicks in it does start to look a bit rough also worth bearing in mind the optical zoom cameras on both the pro and the pro max they're not 24 megapixel they're so 12 as is the ultrawide lens which is pretty normal for a phone but it just feels like one of the only slight remaining inconsistencies but camera comparison versus the Samsung coming very shortly so if you want to see that then he's sub to the channel would be Mega pixel now based on some browsing on X people are worried about battery and rightly so the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max had insane battery for their prospective sizes but then the 14s were not as good and they also seem to degrade faster over time now that could be a few different things it could be the iOS 17 beta that was pretty rough on battery it could be the extra brightness of the screen putting more pressure on the battery and causing more heat on the inside which can permanently degrade your cell whatever it was Apple didn't really acknowledge or address any battery concern so it's not clear if any of those long-term effects will be present but what I can say is that the iPhone 15 Pros are better for sure than the 14 Pros with a bigger battery capacity even more mature software and better heat dissipation which should make that battery last longer over time but as well as a camera test there will also be a very detailed battery test alongside it so there will be a lot to talk about there I am slightly sad to see that the charging speed hasn't gone up which would have been one of the main perks of a USB 3 Port but at least the phone does leverage some of the capability of USBC with the ability to reverse charge your airpods what actually is great news and what I'm really surprised Apple didn't talk about at the event was that it's not just airpods the fact that your iPhone 15s can now deliver power through USBC means that almost anything that you can plug this cable into you can charge which means that for the first time since switching to the iPhone like four years ago I don't have to feel like I'm the battery lead in my friend group I guess the main perk of iPhone being USBC now is some semblance of stability this move was always on the horizon it always felt like it could be just next year when Apple switched over and so now that it has just happened you can safely invest in some USBC accessories that you know won't become outdated for at least a couple of years but probably more I know there's been a lot of rumors about the portless iPhone but honestly I I just think they're a long way off there are so many things that would suffer if Apple made that move anytime soon like being able to listen to proper lossless music being able to transfer massive prores video files which apple is touting as one of the new features that you should use as well as all kinds of really Niche things like using your phone as a screen to Pilot a drone where you need the lowest latency possible in order to bring this all together then we need to consider the prices for the iPhone 15s the pro is staying at its price of 999 and the pro Max is going up by 100 to 11.99 to which I would say I think the normal Pro is in a really good place right now it's an iterator phone but one that ties together a lot of the Loose Ends that Apple has had over the years integrating all the bitty camera features together sanding down the rougher edges of the design and bringing a little lift to the battery while it's at it the pro Max is a bit of a harder pill to swallow since the only additional difference for the extra hundred dollar Gap in price is more storage and your 3x lens becoming a 5x lens which is an upgrade but not a massive one and one that in some situations can leave you with worse shots than the 3x but that does not invalidate it the 15 Pro Max is still the phone for people who want the best iPhone it's the phone that I've already switched to especially because of the battery and also important note the phone isn't actually necessarily more expensive if the quoted prices Apple gives are always us but like here in the UK the 15 Pro Max is the same price as the 14 pro Max and that's the 14 pro Max with half the storage okay we'll see you in the comparisons"

		"captions": "all right so today I got a hold of and got to poke around the new iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pros I do remember flying here and I'm thinking what could Apple possibly do like what could they possibly introduce with a new iPhone the 23rd iPhone that's actually interesting now there is more stuff than just the iPhone that was mentioned at this Wonder lust event that Apple hosted including some stuff that straight up wasn't mentioned on stage at all so we'll get to that but this is just the new iPhone stuff so stay tuned to get subscribed to see the rest but let's just talk about the new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro so here's a lens to look at all this stuff through coming into this basically everything Apple just added to their newest Flagship phones falls into two buckets it's either something we've already seen in some other phone for years or it's some ecosystem feature that only works with other iPhones which is not necessarily a bad thing but it's just just a lens to look through this stuff at just to keep an eye on it so this is the iPhone 15 there's the same two sizes again iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 plus and yeah you know there's some small changes like the slight soft Corner radi on the aluminum rails and the one piece glass back fading between a lighter and darker version of the same color like this new pink one it's pretty seamless also satin soft touch backs across the whole lineup instead of glossy I definitely like that but the big headlining feature really is it's USB now lightning is officially dead these new iPhones are all USBC across the board now on one hand this is a huge deal like there's only ever been one Port change in the iPhone ever back in 2012 we went from that 30 pin connector thing to this new lightning thing which we've had ever since and now the second one ever is USB type-c but on the other hand it's I don't know it's just USB like it's the same port all these other laptops and tablets all over the planet I've had for the past couple years I imagine it might be another year or two before the whole lineup like the Baseline cheap iPad and the iPhone SC and everything else gets USBC but yeah I don't know we knew it was coming but it's still kind of surreal to look at an iPhone and see a USB port on it so what does this enable it's a real question right uh first of all it's the one cable that you can ideally use to charge all your stuff so your Mac your iPad your iPhone your friends Android phone the new airpods which just got a new USBC case all that stuff one cable oh and now you can charge accessories like the new airpods with the wire so there's no Wireless reverse charging right now but that ctoc cable that comes in the Box so you can like plug it in the iPhone plug it into the airpods and charge the airpods up from the iPhone battery so that's pretty cool but they did hold back on one very key thing and they saved it for the iPhone 15 Pro so I'll get to that in a bit but that's USBC aside from that really it's a slightly updated phone it's a little bit of a new display you know you get the dynamic Island here of course on these Baseline iPhones and there's also now a higher Peak brightness 2,000 nits now which is twice as bright as the iPhone 14s and there's a new camera the primary camera is now a 48 megapixel chip presumably the same one that was in the iPhone 14 pro last year and all the benefits that come with that and then the rest of the phone really follows that same formula they do this thing where the new Baseline phone is basically last year's Pro phone repackage so it inherits the same a16 Bionic chip from last year's Pro phone the coolest feature of this phone though and you know it's also in the Pro phone but I still think it's pretty solid is the camera has this new Next Generation portrait mode but basically automatically detects when there's a subject in a photo and captures all of the depth information needed to be able to turn it into a portrait mode photo later so you don't have to remember to switch it to portrait mode necessarily every time and if you ever forget but want to add that blur later you can do it with high quality results so that's cool aside from that the rest of the phone I mean it's the same thing right same sizes guys same ceramic Shield same dust and water resistance and same starting prices $7.99 for the 15 and $8.99 for the 15 plus so then there is the pro phones the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max there is some more new here a lot of it I'm actually want to going to want to test just to see if it's actually what they say but make sure you get subscribed to see those full reviews when they come out later this month and we can figure out if the phones are worth it but basically it's not bleeding edge stuff that we've never seen before it's just welcome stuff and those are mostly in build quality the chip inside and the cameras so let's just start with the chip inside first of all it's a brand new chip that's called the A7 Pro it's the first time they've used the word Pro in an iPhone chip and it's their first 3 nanometer chip so it promises some performance and efficiency improvements as a result I think they said it's like 10% faster high performance cores and the neural engines up to twice as fast bunch of other stuff not sure how much of this you'll actually notice in everyday use but hey future proofing and Headroom is never a bad thing so this is clearly a powerful chip they showed a demo of a game with like faster raid tracing which isn't new but you know it helped make their point but the interesting thing to note here with this chip is they mentioned the chip has a new usb3 controller on it which means the 15 and 15 plus don't have that so basically that means the pro iPhone's USBC Port actually gets upgraded usb3 speeds the faster data transfer speeds up to 10 gbits per second but the base iPhones without that controller they get USBC but they're going to be stuck at USB 2.0 speeds basically the same we've always had with lightning like 480 megabits per second now this probably won't make a real difference to most people like I don't know when the last time you plugged your phone in was but it's kind of a bummer that not all of the benefits of USBC come to all of the phones uh but for the pro phones that are going to be shooting more prores video or Pro Raw photos I mean it takes forever if you've shot this stuff like I have you know it takes forever to get those off of the phone cuz they're big files so I kind of wish they'd gone all the way I wish they' done Thunderbolt speeds 20 30 40 megabits gigabits per second uh but yeah it's it's just going to be USB 3 on the pro iPhones and USB 2 on the bass iPhones you know what is disappointing though no fast charging like this I talked about this on the podcast on waveform I'll try to link the episode below but like switching the USBC you'd think oh this is a huge opportunity for Apple to like explain why they're doing it and we know why they're doing it but oh why are you giving us this new port and all this this big new USBC deal and it's it's just the same 20 or so watt charging we've had for the iPhone for forever no new fast charging kind of figured they would try to do that better but yeah this will still take an hour and a half 2 hours to charge but anyway the new design is what most people are fawning over at the moment with the pros so they have switched the rails from that shiny fingerprint stainless steel to this new grade five titanium alloy with a brushed texture and it's nice it is first of all it's noticeably lighter in the hand which I love and it seems like it's also enabled them to shrink the body of the pro iPhones just a little bit so they have the same screen sizes but the screens now get even closer to the edges and there's even thinner slightly thinner bezels and I actually do notice that now a lot of people are also quoting stronger as one of the benefits too but I really don't think this is going to make as much of a difference as people are thinking like the pro iPhones have had this stainless steel rails for a while now I've dropped this phone as you know I don't have a case on the ground I've dented the stainless steel rails it's fine it doesn't break it's not the stainless steel that breaks it's a glass that breaks and as far as we can tell it's the same ceramic shield glass on the iPhone 15 Pro that hasn't changed so if you drop it on the glass you're still going to have not great results uh but yeah technically sure titanium is stronger either way the new colors are black white and this new blue which is really subtle and then natural which I guess it kind of Embraces the raw titanium feel reminds me of Starlight if you're curious kind of like this warm tone weirdly I think I like it the most but also something else Apple said on stage and this this was pretty quick so you might not have even picked it up but they did mention that they have redesigned a bit of the interior of the chassis to make the back glass more replaceable so it's a more repairable iPhone design technically it's a small thing it's just one little step but it's a step in the right direction for a more repairable iPhone but my favorite feature and before we get to any of the cameras I honestly think this is my favorite feature is uh the new action button a new customizable button on the side of the iPhone just the pro iPhone so it replaces the mute switch which is pretty iconic but it's in the same spot as the mute switch and it it's actually customizable so it's a pretty small button basically about the same size as the switch and by default it actually behaves just like the mute switch did so you you actually hold it down to switch between muted or ringer on great but if you dive into the settings there's actually a section for this action button and it's actually really in-depth and super solid it basically lets you go through and pick the function of the button and there's way more here than I expected so you can keep the mute switch on or you can have it switch you in and out of a certain Focus mode like do not disturb or you could pick whichever other one you want you could also have it auto launch the camera and pick whichever camera mode it opens you could also do flashlight turning on or opening up voice memos or it can toggle the magnifier or the last option actually is you can have it trigger a series shortcut which as you know can technically do almost anything including basically launching any app on your phone I think there may be a bit of a delay from the button press to the app opening if I'm thinking about this correctly like it's done in the past but I'll have to test that for the full review but theoretically you can map this button to open whatever your calendar app your to-do list app whatever app you want which is totally not what I expected to be on the list of things you could do with a new button on the side of the iPhone but now you can but then last but not least the new cameras across the board here there's a new larger 48 megapixel main sensor for the pros and improved Ultra wide and then the pro Max just the pro Max gets a new intricate folding 5x telephoto camera I'm guessing if I asked Apple they would say that there was only enough room in the bigger Pro Max to fit this folding lens I'll ask we'll see what they say but until then the regular 15 Pro is going to still have the 3x telephoto the regular 3x from last year and then we found this seemingly random feature it's in the settings they also talked about it in the keynote but where you can change your default focal length to be either 1X or 1.2x or 1.5x for some reason so it's buried in the middle of the camera settings but you can tell it to default to one of these specific three focal links so if you switch back to the camera app that 1X button is now always going to take you to the new focal length that you've chosen and you can still get to 1x or whatever other focal length you want but I just found that interesting so maybe if you somehow if you're someone that takes 1.2x photos so often that you want a button to get there as fast as possible because it's the perfect focal length for you then sure maybe if you're a photographer you don't want to do the work of digital cropping just hit that focal length every time sure but there's been a lot of comments that at the end of the day it feels like USB is literally the big biggest headlining new feature of this year's new iPhone which is crazy I I can't quite get rid of my lightning cable yet there's still some accessories there's like mag safe Duo there's airpods Max there's like the magic Trackpad there's a couple things that still are lightning now maybe they'll switch that in the next couple months but now I'm genuinely curious if there's going to be a bunch of new USBC phone accessories because of the iPhone getting USBC uh similar to our sponsor of this video ankor so they've made a whole new lineup products for the iPhone 15 headlined by the anchor Nano which is like this little small But Mighty USBC power bank that can crank out 30 Watts with the built-in USBC cable and you can also charge it up 30 WTS and if you have that little button up at the top here it'll actually show a literal percentage of how much battery you have left or if you're plugged in it'll show you a time which counts down so you really know exactly how much of the 10,000 milliamp hours you have left plus there's some other stuff in the lineup there's a wall charger braided USBC cables Galore so feel free to learn more about Anchor's new line up at the link below and shout out to Anker for sponsoring this video so iPhone 15 Pro will start at the same price as last year which is $9.99 but they've bumped up iPhone 15 Pro Max sneakily interestingly it will start at $1.99 but it's also the only one with a 5x camera and it's the only one that starts at 256 gigs and last year the price of the 256 gig Pro was the same so you're kind of matching it's just like getting rid of the $1,100 phone for some reason either way let me know if you're interested in these new iPhones at all you're either in Camp don't care at all or you're in Camp like totally getting one of these or maybe you're watching to see if the reviews prove that the new features are worth it let me know what you're thinking comment section's always open thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one get subscribe see you later [Music] peace"

		"captions": "[Music] okay Apple's iPhone 15s we're looking at all four devices here we have the iPhone 15 the 15 plus the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max uh having spent a few days with these devices there's so much more to talk about than I'd originally thought let's start off here with the 15 and the 15 plus so both of these devices have an aluminum build still they're roughly the same size and shape as the previous generation the biggest difference aesthetically is going to be the rounded edges now if you look at Apple's marketing material they do such a good job selling it right it makes it look like they've created some aluminum pillow for your hand it looks so smooth and soft in the imagery it does look really good apple did a fantastic job making these new iPhones look just distinctly iPhone this is the new rounded Edge design and they have that design language right now no one else is doing it and the same thing goes with the pro devices these have the same rounded edges as the non-pro and they just look so cool I feel like the design language on this is nice especially with that nice titanium color but the moment you case it the design language is kind of lost now in terms of materials the iPhone 15 and 15 plus have that aluminum rail on the side but they also have a new satin finish gloss back and during the presentation they're like this is some color infused glass material and I was like what's so special about that but I realized this isn't just regular glass this is I mean it's a derivative gorilla glass right so colored Gorilla Glass is very uncommon and I thought why would they even do this like what is what was wrong with the previous iteration of the iPhone right so this is the iPhone 14 and it's just a glass back and the way that they color it is they just add a colored layer on the bottom of it and then just the color goes through that see-through glass right why not just run this and I honestly the only thing I can think of like the only thing that thinks like okay maybe this is why it's that if you have colored glass you get to vary the kind of intensity of the color based on the thickness of the glass so on this portion of it where there's like a thin layer of glass it's like a faint pink but then when you have it on the camera hump so it's a thicker layer of glass it's just a more intense color because there's just more of those color particles in it and it's kind of neat but I'm like I don't know it seems it seems a little strange that they focus on this thing but I guess that's what they're going for now the colors are really pale when I started the event I was like those look pretty muted but in person the blue looks like it's like this it almost looks white right almost looks like a very cool looking white color but all the colors this year are almost pastel the pro devices have a titanium Rail and these look really nice to me so they have like a brushed finish to them it's very subtle you kind of have to put it like right up to the camera to see but I think it looks really cool I will say that the fingerprints on the natural color don't show up very readily like it's very good at hiding fingerprints but the black device uh this shows up more ready like this yeah you can see it right here like you can just see the kind of greasy smudges on it also I've noticed that sometimes like the buttons of the area around the buttons it just kind of builds up kind of like smudgy stuff but these are just little details I only bring this up because I feel like because this is the flagship device and the flagship material some people just really care and I thought I'd just share my quick experiences with it but I do think that this like the natural titanium man this is such a nice looking color like everything about this metal just Vibes with me I mean look at me I have a gray set like I love everything gray you my watch is great right when was the last time you saw an all gray phone they're not common the last one I had I think was like the Samsung Galaxy S9 uh okay in terms of its weight so this with its titanium rail is a lighter phone than the previous generation like the iPhone 14 pro now one thing to keep in mind is that even though the weight difference isn't substantial like numerically I think because of the distribution of weight this is it's just a different feeling kind of phone so this is like if you think about the weight distribution on this thing this now has an aluminum plate and because it's got that aluminum plate with the titanium frame I think the weight is distributed more evenly across the whole device on the iPhone 14 pro this didn't have an aluminum plate and there was also a heavier steel frame that wrapped around the perimeter of this device but when compared to the 15 Pro Max this device is just the weight distribution makes this device feel a lot lighter than like you know the eight or nine percent weight reduction that it has it's only single digit in terms of like the absolute number but it definitely feels more I want to use the word agile but what are we talking about like agile phones what I'm trying to make is that this device has it feels a lot lighter than just that that what the numbers would seem to indicate right eight or nine percent doesn't seem that much but it feels a lot lighter and feels good okay I want to move over to the cases so Apple's iPhone cases the ones that are available in the store uh there's like your classic silicone which I'm going to put onto this one just to demonstrate real quick but they also have in their kind of environmental efforts gone rid of the leather cases so this is the fine woven material and it's sitting on top of a pro Max here so the 15 Pro Max but I have concerns about this material actually let's talk about the silicone this feels awesome right I feel like I'm a huge fan of silicone and I don't think that the shape of this case has changed much despite the new rounded edges but this fine woven material this stuff for one it scuffs very easily so I'm just going to demonstrate really quick I'm just take my fingernail don't have super long fingernails right I I mark it uh and it's there and it doesn't go away like this is their pretty much permanently uh and if I did it a bunch of times it would just scuff and unlike leather like leather scratches quite easily as well but that kind of patina is nicely it's got this kind of worn leather look to it it's a look worn like cloth I don't know it doesn't it's not a look to me also this doesn't feel particularly premium I understand it's recycled material but this feels like almost like a cheap polyester kind of like bed sheeting it's strange and it's got that like it's not my favorite material and the fabric is quite thin if you compare this case to like the pixel 5 case this is obviously a dated case quite a few years back but this looked and felt like a very substantial weave case right this is like maybe they had to keep it thin for the magnets like I just I'm just thinking maybe because of magsafe they need the magnets to be a particular strength they got to keep this material really thin so the accessories stick to it I don't know but it just ain't my speed uh there is a clear case a new clear case from dbrand this is called their ghost case so you can see through it and you can see the language the design language and the materials of the new phones which is kind of cool uh I want to talk about the action button so on the iPhone 15 and 15 plus it still has that standard mute switch we've seen this for well over a decade on the iPhone uh and it's just like your standard switch to turn notifications on and off but the new iPhone 15 Pros have an action button and this is a button that's a customizable input and it's the first kind of customizable button we've ever had on an iPhone which is kind of cool but does take some time to get used to because we're so used to just mute switches from literally over a decade of using stuff like that they software control for muting the phone now is a little bit different but in terms of what you can do with the action button there's a whole bunch of things like uh like you can put different Focus modes you have your camera launcher you can launch a flashlight voice memos shortcuts I've personally set it to the camera and for me it's just like any time I've ever had any kind of like winter sports I'm just you can't launch the camera without taking off your gloves and like launching the phone or you have to have like touch sensitive gloves that can like you're like poking your screen to be able to long press a button to launch a camera so much easier it's so Android a lack of a better term but I like it and I think most people will as well just take some time to get used to it now I do wish there was some kind of tactile marking on it so you could feel for it in your pocket to know that this was the thing that you were long pressing to do your action all right let's talk about the display so the iPhone 15 and 15 plus have significantly improved displays compared to the previous generation I think they changed them in ways that just I wouldn't have expected so these now both have bigger screens than the iPhone 14 and 14 plus from last year these have the same screen size and resolution as the Pro Models these have the same brightness the same Peak brightness the same Dynamic Island up top it's got the same HDR capabilities it's really weird how close they are in terms of the overall screen I'm most surprised by the 2000 nits in Peak brightness it's just for legibility when you're Outdoors but that's something that companies usually reserve for like their Flagship stuff but the non-pro models are still missing two features first it doesn't have an always-on display if that matters to you but the second thing is that this is still running a 60hz display on the non-pro amateur model and I really think they use it to distinguish the difference between like the pros and the amateurs because I don't think that the cost of production is that far apart at this point at least not for Apple because the volumes are so high but when I review these phones and you see them side by side the 60 hertz just it's got the stutter right but I really think if I remove myself from this situation I try to like not be a sweaty tech nerd about it I really think like 99 of the world doesn't care about it I've shown it to many of my friends and my family members I was like yeah that's cool that promotion is neat and all but like who cares uh and in that line it's like very very little media takes advantage of that stuff very few games takes advantage of 120 hertz but it's mostly just the UI right when you're in the UI and you're browsing on your phone you're doing stuff having promotion is just so much nicer to look at if your eyes are used to it and the fact that they don't have it is just ridiculous because there are phones out there that are like 300 bucks that have 120hz displays for it to be missing on a 700 phone it hurts and in terms of the bezels on the uh regular iPhone 15 the bezels are a little bit thinner compared to last year these are more aligned with like the 14 pro models from last year but the 15 Pro Models they're very thin the bezels I will say I this is just anecdotal story here when I'm playing games sometimes the meat of my hand would be touching the screen and because the bezels are so thin it would interfere with the button inputs of my fingers it was uncommon but it did happen a few times on the 15 Pro also I think the front glass on all the new devices is actually slightly curved at the edges if you run your finger against it you can feel it so screen protectors might not easily cover that full front screen and in terms of the ports so thanks to the EU we have USBC ports baby we've always wanted this I'm still in disbelief that this is like something I'm staring at USBC ports on an iPhone uh so the regular iPhone has USB 2 speeds uh pro model has USB 3 speeds there's no like malicious intent here I see a lot of the comments are like oh my gosh why does the you know the regular iPhone 15 still have usb2 I think it's just the chip this chip that's in here the the a16 bionic it was never meant to have USB 3 speeds it was just not a thing when that chip was developed and that's the chip that's in here so no USB 3. now if you do frequently dump massive files from your phone onto your laptop and you do need that speed you got to go for that iPhone 15 Pro but you also need a new cable because the one that comes in the box is this thing here so this is a very nice looking braided cable double ended USBC however this is USB 2.0 I see my Twitter light up with people who are very angry about this it's very normal like I can't think of any phone company or a laptop company even that does include a USB 3 cable for charging it's invariably like USB 2.0 that's the industry standard when it comes to charging cables for charging uh okay the other things you can plug up to that hole basically anything with a USB connection you can plug up keyboards and monitors you get like 4K 60 DisplayPort out and you can charge your iPods you can charge the old ones with lightning cable and the new ones with the USBC cable because the new one has a USBC Port now in terms of performance the a17 chip is faster like you would expect and it can sustain a full workload a little bit longer than the previous generations of the iPhone Pros but it's nothing crazy like I don't think at this point people are using their phone to me like man if only this phone was faster right that's just really not a thing I will say that the GPU has seen like the biggest jump this year uh they did showcase some games I was able to test out an early build of Resident Evil Village this looks very good for a phone it's a really demanding game I remember benchmarking this thing on like RTX 3080 laptops even last year and to see it running on a phone with all the original assets at a consistent 30 frames per second is very cool it feels like the GPU capabilities on this phone is similar to like a PS4 like an Xbox one it's it's very impressive considering the size of it but it's like in case people are wondering like is it like a PlayStation 5 it's not but considering the size of the device very impressive now in terms of battery life so I ran the same battery testing that I did three years in a row now and I didn't see much of a change in terms of like the overall battery life of the phone but what I did notice was a big spike up in the gaming battery life so Pokemon unite isn't a very demanding game but it does just suck up juice and I ran this test a couple times it's a lot better this year I think it's just the GPU on the a17 pro a lot more efficient okay I'm gonna wrap up with a conversation about the camera but I'm going to steer this conversation to just how I use the camera like the stuff that I find interesting or important about the camera so all four of the new iPhone 15s this year have a 48 megapixel main sensors both the regular devices and the pro devices the sensor on the pro devices are going to be bigger and better but still 48 megapixels and they also shoot with 24 megapixel files so if you took like the original 12 megapixel file from yesteryear and you added 50 more pickles pickles pixels going up and then 50 more pixels going wide that would be the new shot so it's about 50 bigger in terms of file size I would say on the regular iPhone 15s the shots in 24 megapixels are more detailed slightly but I just don't think worth that exercise uh the extra 50 size is like it fills up your phone faster it's harder to work with you're sending out more data if you're sharing photos it's just it's a lot and I don't feel like the sensor on the regular iPhone 15s really makes good use of that extra resolution but on the pro I would say it is worth it uh they just the detail is there I think it's absolutely worth that larger file size so if it were me my decision if I had either one of the regular phones I would just set it to the 12 megapixel shot and just save that file space and then if I had on the pro I mean the 12 megapixel shots still look better anyways but if you want that extra resolution and you don't mind the larger files it can take advantage of it now in terms of low light photography it's still not great I mean Apple talked a little bit about how they improved it but the pixel 7 devices and Samsung's s23 devices look better to me Apple also talks about how they addressed some of the lens flare that has been in some of their photography so sometimes you'll see some reflective orbs floating around some of your shots uh they're definitely less pronounced on the iPhone 15 cameras but they're still visible here and there and it's particularly noticeable still in night shots with bright lights now in terms of the multiple focal lengths that they have for the main sensor I can shoot like 24 28 and 35 millimeter when I first saw the presentation I was like that's kind of neat but isn't it just like crops like it seems like it was just cropping in on that main sensor it turns out there's a lot more to it so there is a very interesting technical method as to how they do it like so they're capturing light data from multiple lenses and then fusing it together to create the image it's very cool in terms of how it's done but in terms of how I use my camera like I don't feel like I've ever taken a shot and switched I wanted to even you know the difference between a 24 and a 28 millimeter is very small at least for the stuff that I shoot and then even at 35 not that useful for my personal photography okay but the thing that I thought was the coolest thing by far is the automatic portrait mode and I actually think that this is going to be copied by other phone companies it's the ability to just basically take a shot not think about it and the phone will capture the depth data so you can adjust the focus later and to not think about it like to just not have to press portrait mode and just and just does it automatically is super cool so if it detects a face or like a human face or A Pet's face it can supposedly do it I did notice that it only works for like large pets like my kid has a goldfish it didn't work for that but if you have just regular large faces it works and it works really well and just the ability to adjust this stuff in post but not think about it when you take the shot is so useful like it's just a nice looking shot but you do need to keep in mind that that original shot that you take has to be in Focus like if it wasn't in Focus that it won't be able to fix it uh using this portrait mode stuff uh okay last thing the zoom so I'm sure you're aware by now the iPhone Pro Max iPhone 15 Pro Max has a zoom lens and this thing is a 5x optimal actually you can see the difference between so this device here is the regular other 15 Pro and you can see the lens right there and the 15 Pro Max has a much larger aperture for that zoom lens a couple thoughts I don't think that the 5x telephoto is particularly powerful Samsung has 10x opticals that just are twice as powerful I think that it's good that they're back they're more competitive in terms of the Zoom game they've been comically behind for years I would say the pixels 7 Pro their 5x Zoom is arguably better in terms of like sharpness and detail that's able to capture at that 5x but the fact that the iPhone has a 5x Zoom is great now I think the one conversation that might come up is like should you get the pro or the sort of the pro Max or the pro because when you go with the pro Max your Zoom range is like you start at 5x and anything underneath 5x is not an optical zoom it's like cropped sensors and on this device because it has the 3x Zoom like the original older style 3x Zoom you do have that kind of mid-range telephoto covered a little bit better my take on it is that it doesn't matter it really doesn't matter if I mean if you're getting sweaty over this because you're like a professional photographer that's a whole separate question but if you're just someone who wants to buy a phone and you want to take photos like normal human beings with your family and friends and just things that you do in your life don't buy the phone based on its zoom capabilities buy it for everything else that's just my take on it okay pricing the base models start at 800 the pro model started a thousand but I found that chart again where someone on Reddit had graphed out or charted out the percentage of yearly income that it would take for someone to purchase one of these base model iPhone 15s it spread across a lot of different countries but at the top of the list was Myanmar that's the country my grandmother was from and it's just crazy to see how expensive this phone can be for a lot of people in this world I think it's something we should keep in mind when we look at the prices of these iPhones okay there you have it the iPhone 15.

		"captions": "Well, why did you put me here? I don\u2019t even know what to tell you. It means nothing has changed, okay, let\u2019s go. Our tech blogger New Year is over. Presentation of new Apple devices, or rather Apple Watch. Apple has gathered its most titled employees in the pronunciation of the words Amazing in cradible and in a.  battive My name is Arseniy Petrov, you went on Velsak channel in a few minutes to find out what actually happened there, the Apple Watch 9 series started, they are the same as last year, but now they have 2,000 no brightness new chip S9 chip U2 quick access to Siri and new  a gesture for very intelligent people or for those who want to shut someone up like oh yeah, that\u2019s what I did and that\u2019s all, thanks. Using gestures with the help of different movements of the hand, you can answer if your second hand is for some reason busy performing some actions on the watch. for calls there, start or stop the timer Well, and so on In short, the feature is cool, the guys there have improved the tracking of women\u2019s cycles, in short, and new features have appeared for cyclists; charging has become a little faster. Well, in principle, all the series of 9 have really gotten better, but only internally they work better  in the case of 10, the animation is smoother here and there but overall nothing new colors 5 rose gold just gold gray little black and red and three more colors of the steel version which also has the Tsar\u2019s Gold Why is the iPhone in Gold No, we\u2019ll find out a little later now Apple Watch Ultra Everything  We were waiting for a new color but to hell with it they are the same as the previous ones But they have a brightness of up to 3000 nits 36 hours of operation on a single charge up to 72 hours in power saving mode there is also a new ugly dial from Aliexpress But I am about the same fake Apple Watch Ultra unpacked which cost 2,500 rubles, all some small chips for athletes, small chips for those who like to conquer heights or dive into the depths of the sea, basically nothing else Ultra two costs from 799 dollars Well, that\u2019s great, Lord, couldn\u2019t they have given the boys a new Ultra color and what  something new to come up with on the clock, what are we doing, what are we doing, something I was so carried away by iPhones that I forgot to eat, so I ordered myself a small snack I ordered it all from Yandex food where there is a huge amount of food for every taste from restic shops, everything arrives warm and arrives The main thing is quickly  We are so used to Yandex food that we forgot that this is a very technological company, there are more than 500 of the smartest people in it, developers, analytics, products, everything. They work every day to ensure that all these boxes come to us on time and without problems if you stopped the video right now  and Such people will go and order something to eat, but there is an increased demand. I have three life hacks for you. The first is to wait, as a rule, after 15 minutes. Everything will be back to normal; the second is to order food in a restaurant, first go there with your feet; everything is already ready to be picked up and brought home; and the third  lifehack is just to choose a restaurant closer to you, as a rule, there is so much in Yandex.e that there is a good place in any area Yandex food - I use this service literally several times a day just all year round and even when I don\u2019t order food and want to cook something all  you can find anything there. Therefore, if for some strange reason Yandex food is not yet installed on your smartphone, please follow the link in the description and try. Well, at least it\u2019s delicious, and we continue with the video. Well, then Apple blamed for the environment and didn\u2019t do it for so long  that I wo n\u2019t even retell this, local Svetlana Permyakova came out to unwind the boys and said you are harming the environment too much, they seem to have been justified, they say we generally have recyclable material here and there, so now we will start selling Apple Watch without a box at all. Well, in the sense that the box will be a little smaller and  also, watch straps are now made entirely from recyclable materials, even luxury rms versions, all of these leather ones will now be made either from gaskets, sorry, or from bottles Well, in short, you understand, no genuine leather Well, finally, let\u2019s move on to the most important long-awaited and important  kayfon 15th generation new standard iPhone 15 now matte Hooray new glass on the back with double ion exchange technology literally saturated with color and colors by the way 5 They are very nice pastel ones, not flashy, unlike previous generations iPhone 15 went to a barbershop And now instead of bangs he has a very dynamic island  a fashionable thing that you and I use and can\u2019t get enough of, it\u2019s just an innovation of the century for a whole year now it\u2019s in the iPhone 15, the body is slightly rounded 48 megapixels camera with an aperture of 1.6 and God for once on the iPhone 15 it\u2019s finally appeared in the basic one  telephoto lens with a focal length of 52 mm and a 2x zoom the camera has changed now it\u2019s as she was told 48 MP it has a new portrait mode it has become better at separating the foreground from the background And it also has an auto-on mode the iPhone 15 works on the a16 Bionic chip it\u2019s from last year  from the firmware but also quite good very powerful cool more in principle and you don\u2019t even need a chip from your friend in the Central Department Store if she suddenly decided to spend your money again and found herself some kind of bag a cool feature of the iPhone 15 for those who live on branches where they haven\u2019t yet  The subway car has been updated with active noise canceling for calls, you just press a button and cut off all the noise around you, you can speak calmly and you will be heard much better. This is really top. And of course, Lightning has finally died, now even the basic iPhone 15 has usb-c installed and  even you can buy airpods with usb-c, charge them from an iPhone, Android, the world is full of course, they are completely innovative, but nevertheless, and of course, new accessories for both watches and iPhones 15 made from finevavana, by the way, in honor of the transition to usb-c  the main accessory of the decade is presented - an adapter from usb-c to lightning for $ 29 basic iPhones 15 have really gotten better but this is not enough because we want to spend more money and Apple knows this by introducing the iPhone 15 Pro titanium in 4 rather stuffy but very elegant colors This is the lightest iPhone  about the Titan of the fifth level, it\u2019s very light, it\u2019s very reliable and durable, we\u2019ll do drop tests, we\u2019ll see, it\u2019s very interesting, but there\u2019s no iPhone Ultra for us, it\u2019s just tiny, and about Max, like last year, a button for customizable actions appeared instead of this sound lever Yes, which was constantly getting clogged somehow -  then from the early days, now the button can be configured to press the voice recorder camera and in general any commands inside the iPhone pro installed A 17 Pro, that is, not a bionic, but specifically about it, it has six cores 16 cores of a 100% neural engine, the most powerful graphics for processing complex codecs  the processor in history generally works on a three-meter architecture, but now the iPhone seriously has ray training. This means that you will get a picture literally similar to console games, and even Dead stranding promises to be ported to the iPhone, this is very cool. For example, look at Resident Evil Yes, this  means that stop playing in Zoom and 2048 we are really waiting for a New wave of mobile gaming, mobile eSports, that now the cameras will go very far ahead, what I was waiting for was to go show them photo comparisons, but in the firmware nothing has changed at all, almost the same 48 megapixel wide-angle sensor the only thing  it doesn\u2019t take 12 megapixel photos as before, from 24 megapixel ultra-wide they didn\u2019t touch it at all. But this year they decided to separate the pro and Max photos because you have a new phone about Max, a lens with a five-fold zoom and a focal length of up to 120  mm As far as I understand, the lens of the phone has a larger sensor than in the previous generation of iPhones. And also the new 3D optical stabilization, no one else has this anymore. Using this camera you can shoot volumetric video for Apple Vision, although you won\u2019t be able to watch it yet because Apple with at all  not for sale added support for global light standard color correction cutout Now you can write to an external drive because Yes, you understood everything correctly, the firmware also has USB C3, of course, which is capable of transmitting up to 10 Gbit per second, which means that finally all the files are captured  on the iPhone it will be possible to transfer it to a computer Well, at least just transfer it to a computer Thank you, the prices have become higher by $100, the 128 gig version is only left with the regular brooch and in general iPhones start at a thousand bucks, these are the prices in Russia, as I already see, 200,000 rubles Well, we\u2019ll tolerate nothing. You\u2019re waiting for something else, but something else won\u2019t happen because that\u2019s all. But we had to figure out our credit programs for the coming year. It\u2019s true that Apple helped us with this, thank you, we also watched It was Arseny Petrov and short summaries  September Apple presentations in a few minutes so far"

		"captions": "hi everyone Aaron here for zollotech and the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been out a week at this point I've been using it full time as my main device and I wanted to share the overall experience of course we'll share that throughout the years I typically do but the overall experience as far as durability some people are concerned about that whether or not the iPhone 15 Pro Max actually overheats I've tested that in multiple ways we'll also talk about battery life and more but the first thing is the design when you pick up the 15 Pro Max for the first time you definitely notice the weight difference if you're coming from a 14 pro Max going from stainless steel to the new titanium frame definitely makes a difference in the overall weight of the phone it feels more balanced it seems to just be a nicer feel in the hand because of the curved edges and it's just nicer overall it feels more like when you went back to an iPhone 10s Max for the first time and this phone has those curved edges like I said it curves around the edges and goes to a flat side it's sort of like apple went back and combined the iPhone 12 with the iPhone 10 series or iPhone 6 series curved the edges just around the glass or close to the glass met them up to the glass but then gave us that flat side from the iPhone 12 series to give it a little bit more grip however it still is a little bit more slippery than we had with the other phones due to that curved Edge but in general it feels great I've handed this to many different people to check out and they notice it immediately that it's much lighter so that's great news especially because it seemed to be getting just too heavy and large in general this feels much better to hold on to and it's a little bit narrower as well now as far as new features of course we have that action button and I've actually tended to program it just for the flashlight there's not really any other use for me so far of course I'll be testing this out a little bit more maybe I'll program a shortcut to it but I actually figured out I'll just set it up to Flashlight since I use it a lot instead of just setting it to silent like I would normally and leaving it alone at least I have some additional functionality there so again maybe an accessibility feature or shortcut in the future but for now it's set to the flashlight as far as the overall durability well that's been a concern for a lot of people as many people have seen Bend tests where people have snapped the glass on the back so far I've had no issues of course I'm not going to try that but I've had no issues and I've accidentally dropped it on a tile floor once this week so that was something I typically never do and dropped it on the floor and actually found that it took some of the coating off so I opted for the blue titanium color this year I also have a natural titanium one that I use as a video camera we'll talk about in a moment but this one is actually chipped a little bit from hitting the floor so as you can see that you can't feel it at all but it chipped the PVD coating off also I've noticed some wear in the upper corner of this so as you'll see above the action button I'm not sure if that's the same thing but it seems to be getting worse maybe that's from setting it on a table but I typically just have it in my pocket and I set it down on a table so that might wear over time a little bit more and of course if that bothers you you can put a case on it or maybe just go with the natural titanium color additionally of course people are concerned about fingerprints or that looking terrible and it does kind of look terrible if you've got oily fingers or maybe you just have a lot of smudges on it you see it over time and it definitely can look pretty poor at times but you can just wipe that off with a cloth and it seems to fix that issue it's not really much of an issue for me it wipes off much easier than I thought it would it's not really much of an issue if you're bothered by that again put a case on it maybe put a screen protector as I do have some scratches here as well and I'm not sure why but I have a scratch right around this widget here I don't know if you can see it but in the right light sometimes you can see that scratch and so that scratch actually is on the display here there's another small one here and that's odd because I get that on every phone I have so I'm not sure exactly what that is I can't see it even in the regular light here when I bring it outside I can see it but you can actually feel it right here there's a little scratch right there so again like I said you can't really see it very easily in regular light but it's there and I noticed it the other day I'm not sure what causes it but again if you're concerned about that definitely put a screen protector on it it's the same glass we had last year with ceramic Shield so if that held up well for you it should hold up the same as well the cameras this year I've been really impressed with every photo I've taken I've actually said wow that actually looks really good we have a 48 megapixel camera and 12 megapixel Ultra wide in telephoto now the telephoto is a five times optical zoom on the Promax only it looks pretty good I wouldn't say it's amazing but with the processing with it with the new ace 17 Pro pretty much any photo I take out of the regular camera looks great now if you have three times Zoom it's going to use the main camera instead of the optical camera so that might not be as good as it is on the pro phone I'll measure that in comparisons later on but in general the camera really impresses me especially with night photos they look much more natural they look great as you can see here and then of course it captures depth information on its own when it's taking portraits and they've done a much better this job this year actually tracing around hair and much more so photos and everything else look pretty great this year I'm not sure what the big difference is other than the processor but it seems to have made a very big difference also the video out of it is quite good I've been using the natural titanium version that I actually got to record many videos in fact my airpods Pro 2 USBC version unboxing was recorded with this phone completely with this connected to an external SSD in prores log so it recorded without a problem it actually looks great and the autofocus is incredible it's just spot on all the time much better than I've seen before we still do have that minimal Focus distance issue that we had with the 14 pro Max but that's just a limitation of the lens with that larger 48 megapixel sensor you can only get so close so I'm only about a hand width away and it's out of focus so you can turn on macro of course and that fixes that problem but it's definitely going to be an issue compared to the previous phones but it's not too much of an issue as you just back up a few more inches so in general you're going to have that same experience but you can switch to ultra wide and it fixes that problem without any issue so I don't have an issue with that I wish it did have a closer minimal Focus distance like the previous phones but it's not a big enough issue that it's something that I can't use the phones over I can just switch to macro mode if I need to but the video and everything else I've been very impressed so far and that's due to that new processor and now before we talk about speed and things like that let's talk about battery life a lot of people have been wondering and it has about a 4000 422 milliamp hour battery Apple says to expect the same battery life that you get with the 14 pro max phones and I can say that that's pretty much true maybe a little bit better since my battery health has improved but if we go into settings of course they've added some new features this year if we go to General and then about and something they've added with the 15 series phones is the cycle count and manufacture date and first use of the battery the cycle count is great information if you want to know how long your battery should probably last Apple says to expect 80 battery health after 500 Cycles so once it's cycled to 500 you should be close to about 80 percent it's great to have this information there's no reason they can't bring it to older phones though with maybe a future software update additionally battery life in general well there's some things to help that that they've added of course under battery health and charging if we go to charging optimization many of you are already aware that this is an 80 limit this is going to be helpful for those that really want to monitor their phone I'll leave it on optimized battery charging I typically put it on charger at night take it off during the day I've done that since the original iPhone and had no issues with it whatsoever however the 14 Promax seemed to degrade pretty quickly but I think that's due to either the software I'm running using a lot of power or something along those lines but if you really want to monitor this just set it to 80 limit and it will stick there but you'll get less battery life of course now as far as the battery life overall throughout the day it is a little bit better than my 14 pro Max however I've been having some issues and I'm not sure if it's the software early on or what it is but you'll see I'm using Safari 24 of the time and I don't even know why if I go into Safari I don't have anything open if I go to private there's nothing there I deleted my profiles and can't figure out why it just keeps using a power so I'm not sure if it's syncing something in the background it's hard to say I also deleted some apps that seem to have helped tremendously but the most I've gotten out of it is 6 hours and 16 minutes so far this is a couple hours better than I got with my 14 pro Max but I didn't delete the same apps or anything on that device yet so I'd say it's pretty close to what you get with a 14 pro Max maybe a half hour more depending on how you're using it but in general it seems to be okay and for those wondering the actual battery capacity here's coconut battery it's a Mac app you get outside of the App Store and it shows you the capacity of the battery the physical capacity that's different than what some people say it is as far as tear Downs go so that gives you an idea when it comes to charging I've actually not noticed any issues with the exception of one thing if I plug this into my car it's fine but if I use the wireless charger it will get the phone very very hot and it will stop stop charging that's something I saw with previous phones the 14 pro Max does it the 12 will do it it just gets really hot in that car for some reason but if I use mag safe it's fine if I use the USBC cable it's fine all of that seems to be fine and people are really concerned about the phone overheating so I tried out a few different things I placed a 13-minute call yesterday to Apple for an issue I was having no issues whatsoever with that it didn't even get warmer than it is right now just holding it I also recorded one hour of 4K 60 prores log and had this plugged into a dock also it was plugged into an external monitor through that Dock and charging with a 60 watt MacBook charger additionally it was plugged into an SSD all of that at the same time I recorded one hour of footage as you can see here and then I just stopped it at that point that's more than enough footage the phone was definitely warm the SSD was very hot but the phone was warm but I still could touch it it wasn't so hot that you couldn't touch it and that's what I'm seeing from a lot of people that are having this overheat issue not once have I had that overheat message and also I tried playing some games the other day I played some games yesterday you can see that I played Call of Duty mobile pubg mobile as well as I tried to engine impact just a little little bit and so it was about 35 to 40 minutes total of gaming I actually had it plugged in and charging at one point and it really had no issues whatsoever yes it was getting warm but it was not too hot to touch it's going to get warm when it's pushing that much power and charging at the same time it was definitely warm to the touch but not hot to the touch that was the difference the people that are having overheat issues are saying it's very hot I had no problems holding it in my hand while playing the game so it does get warm but it wasn't so hot that it was a problem in fact I've found that it gets about three degrees hotter than other devices that I've used and you can see that right now I have a little thermometer here under the heat sensor it's 85.5 degrees Fahrenheit around the processor or 88.5 or 31.4 degrees Celsius so it's warm but it's not hot at all that's actually pretty typical ambient temperature especially when holding onto the phone now titanium definitely could be a problem not getting the heat out it insulates a little bit more it doesn't transfer heat as well same with glass so they're using the glass with some thermal compound or graphite on the front it seems like in the teardowns I've seen to help dissipate some of that heat that could be an issue but if you're in warmer climates that could be a different issue I'm in about 73 degrees Fahrenheit ambient temperatures most of the time when testing so that may make a difference of course if you're in a 100 degree Fahrenheit environment that's going to make a huge difference so I'd like for Apple to address it at least a little bit but I haven't experienced it and I haven't experienced on any device so the 15 Pro Max I have here this 15 Pro Max my 15 Pro no issues whatsoever so I'm not sure why some people are having it I have the USA version without the the actual SIM card in it I haven't figured out why I haven't been able to replicate what other people are experiencing also for another Quick Heat test let's go ahead and run geekbench 6 see what we get we'll give it a few minutes to run and then we'll check the actual temperature of the phone geekbench is still running we're over halfway through and as we move the thermal camera over you'll see we're at 103 degrees Fahrenheit so it's a little bit warm now this is about three degrees warmer than I got from the 14 pro Max when testing the same thing we're at 104 degrees Fahrenheit 105. if we flip this over let's see if the back is any different so on the back we'll go to the same area the back is at about 103 degrees was the highest I saw there so the front is where it's letting some of that heat out again it is warm but we're not sure what Apple's thermal limits are as well so as you can see here it went down a little bit so it's still running geekbench but this gives you an idea of the overall temperature like I said I find that it's about three degrees warmer than the 14 pro Max in my test so 101 degrees still you can pick that up at 101 degrees it's warm but it's not so hot you can't touch it by any means so I don't know what their thermal limits are but it seems to be within that as we're not getting the overheat message again in the hottest area we're at 104 right there now as far as the display this year the display is the same as last year for the most part it's super bright 2 000 nits outside 1600 nits playing HDR video great viewing angles it doesn't really have pwm it seems to be the exact same rate as last year at about 480 Hertz and shouldn't bother your eyes so pwm definitely shouldn't be a factor this year just like it wasn't on the 14 pro Max the 15s the regular version it definitely has it the 15 Pros don't seem to have much of that at all Apple's new three nanometer a17 Pro processor seems to be super fast for everyday tasks but really not faster that you'll notice it from the 14 pro max if you're just doing regular tasks opening weather opening email going into music playing a song swiping around maybe scrolling through a library everything's smooth with promotion and everything else you're not going to notice a difference there but where you are going to notice the biggest difference is where I mentioned before take a photo it looks phenomenal the portrait modes look great it's calculating all of that information on the fly in real time and it does an incredible job with that Additionally you have more GPU overhead meaning you can play AAA games such as well that's coming later Resident Evil 4 Assassin's Creed those games are actually coming to this device you'll be able to play it plugged into a monitor through USBC if you want to and you have the full game here so that's a big difference it definitely is a big step up as far as that goes but if you're just using it day to day not playing games well you're not going to notice much of a difference at all we have eight gigs of RAM so that should help with games and things like that but in general I don't think most people are going to notice much of a difference as far as that goes it seems nice and fast because of that but with regular tasks there's not much of a change as far as the overall connectivity I did notice a difference there's a new 5G modem here and I noticed that I never seem to lose connections where I used to so there's definitely a difference with that if I turn off my Wi-Fi here give it a second to connect you'll see I have two bars of T-Mobile 5G even if I have one bar I've had no issues driving through areas where I have very low signals sometimes I'll play a song and it will just stop I haven't really had that with this phone so there's an improvement here for sure I'm not exactly sure what the change is as far as that goes but it seems to stay connected and have less issues this time around than I did with the 14 pro Max now as far as the speakers go they're pretty impressive I don't know if they made an upgrade here but when I was playing games the other night with Call of Duty and pubg I was impressed by the speakers and I can have you hear those with one of my YouTube videos so here's my iPhone 14 Pro versus 12 pro video let me turn up the speakers here foreign so I think it sounds pretty good and there was a little stutter there so again it's going to seem very familiar with the 14 pro Max but in general it sounds great I was impressed I'm typically not impressed with speakers on phones that much my 14 pro Max speakers sound terrible after a year I've talked about that in a different video These sound really good and they're clear even at the highest volume so I don't know if they've done any work there but it definitely sounds a little different that way if I had to say there's a few negatives about it well the negatives really would be it's a little bit slippery as I mentioned before that can be fixed with a case or a skin it's also quite expensive of course iPhones typically are but you're around twelve hundred dollars up to sixteen hundred dollars in the US and even more throughout the world and also it could break easier based on what we're seeing and of course those overheat issues some people are experiencing are still unknown so if you're nervous about any of that and you're wondering if you should buy an iPhone 15 Pro Max I would wait maybe a month or two and see what happens usually the early manufacturer sure iPhones have some differences with them than the later ones where they refine things or maybe they fixed the manufacturing process or something else typically Apple will fix those things quickly if there is an issue but either way there's really not any issues I've had but it seems depending on where you live and which phone you get that could vary but again I've had no problems I think it's a great experience so far I'll work on improving my battery life figuring out what's going on with Safari that could just be a bug but let me know your experience so far with the 15 Pro or 15 Pro max if you've picked one up or if you're planning to pick one up what's your favorite color let me know

more than series 8 and its GPU is 30% faster the new S9 chip makes the animations and effects in watch OS 10 look super smooth S9 also has a new four core neural engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast this powerful custom silicon is what allows us to maintain all day 18-hour battery life while adding new features and systemwide improvements to series 9 because it's always on you Apple watch is often the easiest and quickest way to use Siri to check the score close the garage or send a message just raise your wrist in ask it's that simple thanks to the powerful new neural engine Siri requests are now processed on device making them faster and more secure this means that the most common requests like Siri start an outdoor walk workout no longer have to go to the cloud so they can't be slowed down by a poor Wi-Fi or Cellular Connection and because the neural engine can run a more advanced Transformer model dictation on series 9 is up to 25 % more accurate than on series 8 secure on device processing also enables a brand new feature the ability to access your health data with Siri so now you can ask how much did I sleep last night what's my average walking heart rate or how does my mover ring look today and you can log Health Data like your weight or period or that you've taken your medications with just your voice Siri Health queries will be available later this year in English and Mandarin with more languages to follow Apple watch is perfect for interacting with nearby objects like smart locks gym equipment or payment terminals at home or out in the world your watch connects to all kinds of devices making so many of the things you do easier and with watch OS 10 you can use name drop to instantly share your contact information with another person's Apple watch this year Apple silicon enhances another one of our users favorite nearby or far away features the ability to Ping your iPhone series 9 has a new second generation Ultra wideband chip that enables Precision finding for iPhones with the same chip you'll see both the distance and direction to your iPhone and once you get close haptic and audible

a automatically appear at the top of the smart stack so you can instantly fire up a playlist or podcast or if audio is already playing your watch will launch now playing to let you control it series 9 features a big edgo Edge always on Retina Display that's even easier to read Outdoors because it now goes up to 2,000 nits double the brightness of series 8 the display is also better in very dark situations like a movie theater or early morning wakeup because it now goes to down to just one knit these features will be useful every time you put on your watch but that's not all the powerful zip also enables an incredible new capability back to Jeff to tell you about it Innovations on Apple watch like the digital crown and taptic engine along with tap swipe and double click make it simple and intuitive to use Apple watch is also controlled by gestures like wrist rays which brighten the display to let you check the time read notifications or see who's calling with a glance you can even cover the display to silence alerts today we're adding something really cool series non enables an incredible new gesture that uses just your watch hand it's especially convenient for those common situations when your other hand is occupied like walking the dog or holding a cup of coffee we think you'll use this all the time introducing double tap just tap your index finger and thumb together twice it's that easy you can use double tap to answer a call let me show you hi Dedra hey Jeff this same gesture also works to end a call see you later okay bye double tap controls the primary button in an app so you can use it to stop a timer play and pause music or snooze an alarm a double tap will also launch the smart stack from your watch face double tap again to scroll through the widgets just like turning the digital Crown this new gesture is enabled by the powerful neural engine in series 9 which processes data from the accelerometer gyroscope and Optical heart sensor in a complete completely new way it uses a machine learning algorithm to detect the unique signature of tiny movements and changes and blood flow when your hand and fingers perform a double tap check out double tap in [Music] action hello the up hello hello every I feeling my power yeah every tou feeling my [Music] power buy the books but I don't know what books you're talking about I don't know Tina I thought I was on the third floor but I saw a sign that it was second floor and then I try to get every little that I touch it's feeling my [Music] power double tap makes interacting with your watch faster easier and more convenient it will be available next month and we can't wait for you to start using it because once you do it will become one of those magical experiences you rely on every day series 9 will be available in a gorgeous new pink aluminum case plus Starlight silver midnight and product red and stainless steel cases in Gold Silver and graphite across these models we've also been innovating in another important direction towards our industry-leading environmental goals we recently had the chance to share our progress with a special guest welcome to app welcome to app hi I'm be how is the weather coming in yeah I'm going to do the offices already Caron neutral thing right yeah all [Music] yours okay I hope we didn't keep you [Music] waiting mother nature mother nature welcome to Apple how how was the weather getting in the weather was however I wanted it to be let's cut to the chase in 2020 you promised to bring Apple's entire carbon footprint to Zero by 2030 Henry David the row over here said we have a profound opportunity to build a more sustainable future for the planet we share I think our 10:00 said the same thing they all do all right this is my third corporate responsib ability gig today so who wants to disappoint me first well we've got some updates we're excited to share with you materials status is there a materials person here yes we are in the process of eliminating all plastic from our packaging by the end let me guess 50 years from now when someone else is left holding the bag by the end of next year actually when we're also currently using 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosures of all our MacBooks Apple TVs Apple watch what about iPod Shuffle well it's a joke don't you people make Ted lasso well that's a different group um we're also phasing out leather in our iPhone cases what about Brando over there they phasing you out too oh what's next electricity electricity status uh uh uh we're operating on 100% clean electricity what runs on 100% clean electricity every Apple office store and data center runs on clean electricity thanks to you and your powerful wind and and sun and apple offices are already carbon neutral yeah this building is carbon neutral oh yeah we we do it with the mix of clean energy and eliminating Greenhouse emissions it's kind of like if you were to seriously explaining carbon neutrality to Mother Nature right no I'm sorry you want to tell me how photosynthesis works too don't um also over 300 suppliers have committed to using 100% clean renewable electricity what's next Transportation I'm proud to report that we're shipping more products by ocean rather than air which reduces Transportation emissions by 95% 95% not too bad I'm also happy to report that we're investing in projects around the world that protect the Earth's soil plants and trees everyone says they're planting trees we've planted forests oh hello where Paraguay Brazil what are you trying to save the tropical savannah yes and we've also restored mangroves in Colombia what else grasslands in Kenya why our aim is to permanently remove carbon from the [Music] atmosphere what about your water usage we've reduced it by how much 63 billion gallons 63 million billion [Music] as you can see we've innovated and retooled almost every part of our process to reduce our impact on the planet by 2030 all Apple devices will have a net zero climate impact all of them all of them they better they will [Music] okay good see you next year don't disappoint your [Music] mother [Music] awesome as you can see we've been working on some really big environmental initiatives and it's making a difference to share more here's [Music] Lisa at Apple our mission is to make products customers love and protect the planet at the same time 3 years ago we made our corpor corate operations around the world carbon neutral it was the first step towards our most ambitious environmental commitment to date Apple 2030 our plan to be carbon neutral across our entire business by the year 20130 the next step is getting the carbon footprint of all of our products down to Net Zero for Apple Watch series 9 we challenged ourselves to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their three biggest sources materials electricity and transportation maximizing recycled and renewable materials in our products is key to Apple 2030 because they have a lower carbon impact than virgin materials so we use 100% recycled aluminum in our watch cases plus recycled gold tin copper tungsten and more inside of series 9 and for the first time there is 100% recycled Cobalt in the battery we also redesigned one of our most popular watchbands the sport Loop to use more recycled material it is now made with 82% recycled yarn while maintaining the softness and comfort you love electricity is the biggest source of carbon emissions since 2015 we've been investing in renewable energy like this solar installation in central California while helping suppliers do the same and we're excited to announce that starting this year all Apple watch manufacturing is powered by 100% clean electricity charging is another source of emissions while it's a small amount per person across millions of watch wearers it adds up so we decided to do something about it for series 9 Apple will match 100% of your expected electricity use by investing in renewable energy projects around the world finally we looked at how Apple watch gets from the factory to you to cut a missions from transportation we started by redesigning series 9 packaging to be 100% fiber-based And More compact it has a new smaller shape that lets us ship up to 25% more watches per trip and more of those trips will be made with low carbon shipping modes like ocean Freight which emits just 120 of shipping by air our efforts to reduce emissions from materials electricity and transportation resulted in a whopping 78% decrease in the carbon footprint the small amount of emissions that remain are offset by high quality credits from projects like forests and wetlands that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere this last step brings the net carbon footprint of Apple Watch series 9 down to zero making it at our first ever carbon neutral product any combination of aluminum series 9 and new sport Loop is carbon neutal and has been certified by an independent third party to help you recognize it you'll see this new logo on the box we are so excited about this achievement and it's how we plan to get all Apple products to carbon neutral by innovating across design engineering and operations to steeply reduce emissions for applying high quality carbon credits while Apple 2030 is the destination the journey is important too so we looked for additional opportunities to make change leather is a popular material for accessories but it has a significant carbon footprint especially at Apple scale to reduce our impact we will no longer use leather in any new Apple product including watchbands and that starts today now back to Jeff to tell you more we've developed a beautiful luxurious and durable new textile that we're calling fine woven it's made of 68% postc consumer recycled content which has a significantly lower carbon footprint Than Leather fine woven gives the new magnetic link a subtle luster and sued likee feel and it looks great on the modern Buckle too both bands will be available in new colors and offer a sophisticated look for any special occasion we also explored more environmentally friendly materials with our partners this year we collaborated with our MZ on four new styles that draw on their long history in textiles there are two elegant woven bands our first ever knitted band and another in sporty molded Rubber and all come in a range of Rich colors heres radial a modern take on their classic watch face complements these Innovative new styles we also worked with Nike to design new bands that repurpose excess materials and waste reducing the use of Virgin material the new Nike sport band includes colorful flakes of recycled material they create a randomized pattern that makes each band unique for the Nike sport Loop we repurposed yarn from previous Seasons to make the same soft material with a fun new space die look both bands come in a range of dynamic colors and there's a new Nike watch face that shows each passing second on the lines of the globe and that's the new Apple watch series 9 it features a magical new way to control your watch with double tap faster on device Siri

the bigger display is perfect when you choose larger texts both sizes feel even nicer in your hand due to a new contoured Edge on the Aerospace grade aluminum enclosure for the first time ever in a smartphone iPhone 15 has color embedded throughout a single piece of durable color infused glass we use metallic ions to build color into the foundation of the material itself precisely controlling the saturation to create five stunning colors pink yellow green blue and black to provide the durability our users depend on we optimized our custom dual ion exchange process for this new material and Polished it with nanoc crystalin particles then it's etched to create a textured matte finish that feels incredible iPhone 15 has ceramic Shield tougher than any smartphone glass and water and dust resistance so it's built to last an iPhone holds its value longer than any other smartphone this is good for our users and good for the environment since it helps conserve finite natural resources another key part of reaching our goal of carbon neutral products by 2030 is maximizing our use of recycled content as you heard from Lisa earlier the enclosure uses 75% recycled aluminum for the first time we're using 100% recycled cobolt in the battery and 100% recycled copper foil in the main logic board and mag safe charger iPhone 15 has an entirely new Advanced Camera system it is designed to help our users take fantastic photos of everyday moments in their lives we're always looking for ways to make it easier for everyone to take gorgeous photos so we're bringing an amazing 48 megapixel main camera to iPhone 15 it's built for shooting Sharp Photo phot and videos every day with a quad pixel sensor and 100% Focus pixels for fast autofocus this 48 megapixel camera opens up some exciting capabilities say you're outside on a bright sunny day you can maximize resolution with a 48 megapixel photo like this Majestic landscape which captures the fine details of the mountains the Rolling Hills and even the individual shingles on the houses of course most of the time it's best to balance detail and light capture so we use computational photography to take the main camera to the next level the sensor groups every four pixels together into a larger 2 Micron pixel for fantastic light capture then photonic engine takes the image that's been optimized for light capture and combines it with a super highresolution image for Rich details the result is a 24 megapixel photo with Incredible image quality and double the resolution it perfectly balances light and detail and has a practical file size that's great for storing and sharing and with all these pixels we can do more than increase the resolution using the middle 12 megapixels of the sensor we enabled a new 2x telephoto option for capturing photos and 4K video with Optical quality it's like having a third camera it helps you feel closer to the scene and because it's enabled by the main camera it has the same f1.6 aperture and sensor shift Optical image stabilization which helps you take fantastic photos even in low light you can zoom out to capture the whole scene or zoom in for the perfect closeup all with Optical quality when you're shooting videos the 2x telephone photo also has continuous Zoom so you can frame the scene like here in 4k cinematic mode it helps you feel closer to your subject so it's perfect

reflecting on her hair all while preserving the blue of the sky now let's talk about our Zoom range iPhone 15 Pro features a great 3x telephoto camera at 77 mm focal length ideal for classic portraiture for iPhone 15 Pro Max we're using the extra size of the larger iPhone to introduce something unique our longest optical zoom yet 5x optical zoom at 120 mm focal length we designed a stateof the telephoto camera compared to iPhone 14 pro Max it has a 25% larger sensor 100% Focus pixels and an f2.8 aperture the largest of any smartphone phone at this Optical range 120 mm is a very useful focal length great for close-ups Wildlife photos and getting closer to the Sports Action 120 mm lenses are typically long so instead we created an Innovative tetr prism design built right into iPhone the light rays are reflected four times through the glass structure allowing the light to travel for longer in a much smaller Design This creates enough separation between the lens and the sensor to enable the longer focal length and we have our most advanced stabilization yet a combined ois and autofocus 3D sensor shift module that moves in all three directions a first for any smartphone this was critical to support the tetr prism design it provides even better stabilization with up to 10 ,000 micro adjustments per second that's twice as many as iPhone 14 pro this longer focal length gives Pro users a brand new creative option and we can't wait to see the incredible photos they will take the ultrawide camera is also improved with a new anti-reflective coding better night mode and the latest smart HDR in addition to enabling one of our users favorite features on the Pro Models macro photography macro is is one of the seven lenses of the new Pro camera system with a 10x optical zoom range going from 13 to 120 mm focal length making iPhone 15 Pro Max more powerful and more versatile than ever now back to Jaws iPhone 15 Pro will enable great workflows for photographers and filmmakers that previously weren't possible using a USB 3 cable with iPhone 15 Pro enables incredibly fast transfer speeds so it's much faster to transfer your large Pro Raw photos or prores videos to your Mac and now you can use your iPhone with capture 1 to shoot and instantly transfer 48 megap Pro raw directly to a Mac easily creating a Pro Studio suited for today's fast-paced needs iPhone 15 Pro also supports recording prores video directly to an external storage Drive video production can quickly swap drives and keep iPhone as the main camera on set recording to an external drive enables even higher quality recording options pushing prores 4K up to 60 frames per second for the first time a great option for filmmakers to create cinematic slow motion we are also introducing log en coding to make prores even more powerful for our Pro users enabling more range and flexibility for visual effects and color grade in post production with log en coding iPhone 15 Pro will be the first smartphone in the world to support the academy color en coding system or Asus a global standard for color workflows making it easier for filmmakers to use iPhone in their production the iPhone 15 Pro camera system pushes the limits of what you can capture with a smartphone the precious memories you capture on iPhone look incredible when viewing with apple Vision Pro photos and videos look lifelike and panoramas expand to create an immersive experience that wraps around you and there's one more unique feature we've created just for the world of spatial Computing

		"captions": "thousands of Engineers have spent the last year of their lives working on the iPhone 15 and 15 plus what have they changed from the 14. that is genuinely what it looks like on the face of it but I have to say pick the phones up and use them and you realize this is such a jump that no one should ever buy an iPhone 14 from this point on although there's also a few weird slightly sus things going on that we need to talk about okay so I know I joke about these phones looking like basically the same thing as the iPhone 14s but honestly apart from the colors which are very washed out this time around I think the iPhone 15 is an upgrade from every single angle the Frosted back feels way more luxury and now I'd say suits the prices being charged for these phones it's called to the touch the Finish almost feels satin like Smooth matte sides it actually feels very Pro whilst having the convenience of being highly resistant to fingerprints you can't see them even if you try that's partly because of these washed out colors the front and the back now also have rounded edges very subtle to look at but if you ever get the chance to go into an actual Apple Store and hold one of these versus last year's iPhone you also can't not notice how much better it feels I've recently come from the iPhone 14 pro Max and using this iPhone 15 plus it's the same screen size but just noticeably Slimmer a massive amount lighter more rounded softer to the touch I didn't expect how much I'd like it it's kind of felt like when Sony releases a slim version of their PlayStations a few years after the originals and and you look back at the original after that's out thinking if you could come in this size what on Earth were they doing in this size and what I was maybe most surprised to see is that this whole time I've been using the case from my iPhone 14 on my iPhone 15. every button and cutout has worked 100 as intended so worth a try but that might not be the case for every iPhone 14 case aside from the feel the notch has been replaced by Dynamic Island which I think looks better and has some functional perks too like being able to see your ongoing egg timer while looking up the recipe for eggs and then at the bottom you've got the new USBC Port also color matched to your phone and I would say so long as you don't already have like a suite of gadgets made for the old lightning Port it is a good thing it won't be very long until every Gadget is USBC powered and so being on the same standard as them just means you can carry one cable around for everything and also that you can use the iPhone 15s to charge other small gadgets like my PS5 controller was running out the other day and so the ability to just stick it into my phone and not have to plug it into the PS5 itself and sit 20 centimeters away from my screen it felt nice to be a part of the wider ecosystem and it also means you can do fun stuff like plug it straight into most good modern monitors get a latency free 60 frame per second connection load up a game on it connect to PS5 controller via Bluetooth and play this is not a new feature to smartphones as a whole but it is new to the iPhone right let's talk about these screens the iPhone 15 has a 6.1 inch screen and by 2023 standards feels pretty compact the iPhone 15 plus has a 6.7 inch screen which sounds like a small difference but in terms of screen area is a just over 20 bigger and by well I mean anyone's standards really it's a big one I've seen a lot of discourse around the fact that these are 60hz displays and not Ultra fluid 120hz displays meaning that unlike most high-end phones today whose screen refreshes 120 times per second which makes them appear buttery smooth the screens here refresh only 60 which would have been the industry standard but just from like 2015. I've seen a lot of people like 799 phone in 2023 without a 120 hertz display it's an outrage it's a con it's a joke and then the other side that's like well actually the average consumer doesn't know and doesn't care why would Apple bother and the way I see it they're both right in a way the iPhone 15 and 15 plus should have a 90 Hertz or 120 hertz High refresh rate screen they're the most expensive current smartphones that don't have one and yeah I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say it was a little jarring for me at the start feeling all the way around this phone thinking damn the base iPhone actually feels like a flagship this time oh wait oh never mind coming from what I'm used to for the first couple of days it felt laggy especially when changing between the different camera lenses but then also the fact that these phones don't have 120hz displays it doesn't immediately make them some sort of scam like Twitter might make it seem like I handed drisha my fiance one phone with 120 hertz and one phone with 60 hertz and she could only tell which was which when I told her and my parents can't tell the difference even when I tell them and if you don't notice it you're missing out on zero functionality of your phone by not having it so I also wouldn't be doing my job if I said to these people don't buy this phone because it is a 60hz display now there is one caveat to this and that's standby mode if you stick an iPhone on charge and flip it horizontally it'll open this brand new screen saver type interface that I'm actually really starting to rate but because these iPhone 15 screens are locked at 60 hertz as opposed to the pros they can scale up to 120 hertz but also down to one Hertz I guess Apple decided that these non-pro phones would drain too much energy by staying on so the main perk of this whole standby feature kind of disappears but broadly speaking for this whole display debate I would say this if the concept of 120 hertz is something that you're very aware of then you'll probably also notice the difference and if that's something that you know you want there are plenty of great androids at this price like the Galaxy s23 or the Google pixel and then if you really want an iPhone you can just try and find last year's 14 pro for around the same price as the 15 and then if 60 hertz is something you're already used to and you're completely happy with Slash you're thinking what on Earth is this guy going on about then you'll probably actually be quite impressed with the screens this time they're extremely sharp and very bright you might not notice it in most normal environments but so long as you have auto brightness on the next time you're in harsh Sun you absolutely will plus I've already had two quite scary collisions with these phones with some damage to the body but zero to the screens themselves they're very crack resistant the way I think about the durability of recent iPhones is they're not particularly hard to damage but they are very hard to break every iPhone that I've used for a year or so they all end up with scratches in pretty much all areas apart from the camera lenses which in my experience are pretty well protected by the outer rims and the sapphire eating but I've never broken one at least not accidentally charging is on the slower end for 2023. it takes about an hour and a half to fully recharge the 15. two hours on the plus and that's using my macbook's power brick so you're still on one of these bad boys it's gonna be even longer I've noticed it but it hasn't really been a problem for me so far I think ultra high speed charging is cool but the main reason that I'm not upset it's absent here is that you probably won't need it the iPhone 15 has better battery life than any base iPhone I've ever used before not by a landslide you're not getting Pro Max battery here but it is better than the normal sized 15 Pro which I do find quite amusing and you will get six to seven hours of screen on time in a day easy which is on par with the expectation for an Enthusiast phone which I know this isn't but it's priced like one so it should be judged by the same standard and then the 15 plus better than any phone I've ever used on a day-to-day basis before big numbers like the kind of numbers that when I did my battery test which I'll link from this video and it slaughtered my 15 Pro Max made me want to say forget that triple cameras forget titanium and how much do I really need the latest chip because I want this battery just like I want to butter Apple in the subscriber race so if you want to help us to get there then a sub to the channel would be that's a really good yeah okay we need to talk about the cameras I feel like cameras on iPhones and what you're actually getting on each model is nowhere near as clear as it used to be because in a way with these phones what you're getting is less than what you might expect but in a way it's a lot lot more so one of the headline features of the iPhone 15 is a new 48 megapixel camera sensor and so I imagine what most people will do is look at that and then look at the pro iPhones which also have a 48 megapixel camera sensor and think they're the same thing that's actually what I initially assume too but we would be wrong the 48 megapixel sensor on the iPhone 15 is a decent amount smaller than the one on the 15 pros and actually the 14 Pros which in theory should be a pretty major con but I kid you not in practice the software improvements are so massive that I would genuinely rather use an iPhone 15 or 15 plus to capture my entire photos and videos from now on than last year's Pro Max just to be clear yes I'm saying that I think the iPhone 15's camera is better than last year's Pro phones that's not a claim I make lightly the one thing that you lose is zoom the pro iPhones have always had a proper telephoto camera which lets you do this the base iPhones have always had no telephoto camera so you can only do this but because you've now got four times the number of pixels as the last iPhone on the main camera at 48 megapixels you can actually zoom in two times into that to cut out half the image on the top and the bottom and half the image on the sides and still end up with a 12 megapixel area in the middle which is the same res that all of the iPhone 14s shot at just using their normal one-time Zoom mode now it's not exactly the same thing as having a proper zoom camera but the results are better than you might think for a phone that doesn't have a zoom camera but then these new phones start to pull ahead in a very serious way for starters they take 24 megapixel photos even though the 14 Pros also had a 48 megapixel sensor the default photos that you get in auto mode are scaled down to a 12 megapixel shot but the 15s take photos in two times that resolution it's a massive win in daylight conditions like this absolutely pastes my 14 pro Max in detail when the sun's out and you'd kind of expect that Gap to fall the more that the light falls right as then it becomes less about the amount of pixels you have more about how much of the limited light you can let in which this should let more in of except that thanks to the new phones having an extra layer of image processing called photonic engine happening with night mode photos the Gap in a way actually becomes bigger I almost could not believe what I was seeing when I took these samples and then the final key new software perk that this generations of iPhones get is depth information when you take a photo of a person or a pet the phones use both of their cameras at the same time to figure out how far away things are and they store that data as part of the photo file which means anytime you fancy you can come back you can hit edit on one of them add the portrait mode effect and also refocus them all of this is really cool but it just does raise one question which is that why is all of this stuff the 24 megapixel capture the extra processing in night mode the ability to capture depth information and refocus afterwards why is it not also available on last year's 14 Pros the usual answer with most phones is that well it's a next-gen product Within next-gen chipset and all the features require that next-gen chipset and its intelligence to work but the iPhone 15s have the same chip as the 14 pros and in fact the 14 Pros have better camera hardware and also they have a lidar sensor which is specifically built to capture depth information since these are almost all software features that presumably could be ported over it just feels strange that at least at the time of filming nothing has been said about that older iPhones will be able to refocus shots if taken on portrait mode but they won't be able to capture the depth of information without being on portrait mode like the 15's cap but overall I am really happy with the cameras on the iPhone 15s in some ways that you'll actively notice like how it copes with challenging lighting and in other ways that you might not but it's a nice reassurance to have like just knowing that your memories are there in very high resolution should you ever want to print them out or make a slideshow or crop in to post somewhere that you can refocus them to make them just right and that the live photo information is captured by default so you also get that little snippet of video and sound one of the other things that now separates base iPhone turns from their Pro counterparts is the performance the way Apple tends to do things now with their Pro phones you'll get the very latest Cutting Edge chip with the base phones you get last year's chip and I have a feeling that this Gap will only widen over time because historically Apple's chips have been pretty simple you have the A14 the A50 and the a16 but this year apple called the chip on the 15 Pros the a17 pro which makes me very strongly suspect that next year the base phones won't get the same chip they're not going to give the non-pro phones a chip that has Pro in the name right so I'm gonna guess the iPhone 16s will get a trimmed down version of it just called the a17 point being I think that the growth in power on the base iPhones is going to Peter out over the next few years because in the same way that Apple sees 120hz displays as optional for the mainstream well what does the average user need more power for however this jump that we've just had from the a15 and the iPhone 14s to the a60 and the iPhone 15s is a pretty big one you can expect these phones to be about 20 faster than the 14. alongside all the other perks of having a more recent chip they're slightly less powerful than what you would get in similarly priced current Androids but in use it never feels like you've got the short end of the stick I mean basically anything that I've wanted to play on this I played on this no problem the only thing that you will miss out on is the console games that Apple's specifically getting made for the 15 Pros so with all of this in mind are the iPhone 15s worth it well to make a judgment on value we need to factor in the prices they're unchanged from last year if you're in the US but if you're in the UK both the iPhone 15 and the 15 plus are 50 pounds cheaper than the iPhone 14s were at launch which makes it feel like they are back in line and yeah with it in fact the iPhone 15s make the iPhone 14 look like genuinely terrible value for money right now because Apple does still sell the iPhone 14 for 6.99 compared to the 799 for the 15 but for that extra 100 you get a phone that looks better feels a lot better it's faster takes significantly better photos and lasts longer I wouldn't rush to buy it if you're already on a 14 but if you've been holding out for the next iPhone you have my blessing this is one of the best times to upgrade right just before you head off I want to show you something very cool for these phones so this is Taurus and they've got three tiers of phone case each one cooler than the last so the base is the u-pro o sound which is a super protective case it has Maxi built in but also that magsafe ring can flip out and become a kickstand a kickstand that when it's folded away you don't even realize is there but then you can step that up with the U pro o stand R which has the same magnetic kickstand but also adds in the element of full 360 rotation so you can angle the kickstand whichever way you want to bear in mind these cases are also super customizable too like they all come with a free set of replaceable buttons including dark green and orange colors and then this is me and my cat Milo got carried away but then what I think is the craziest case this is the O stand SS and it has built-in airbags no really this entire outer layer is a vacuum sealed air chamber which cushions phone drops by 92 versus not having one and what's also really cool is the insta-fit installation for their Diamond Shield screen protectors it's very quick there's no bubbles or dust on your screen you just slap your iPhone 15 into the frame and the mechanism will do the rest and if you use our link and code in the description this is pretty cool we actually managed to get a full 20 off their normal prices"

		"captions": "[Music] yes you are right guys we are here in Hong Kong video I went here in Hong Kong to personally get my pre-order Apple Store just like what we did last year in Singapore so yes this might be a yearly thing already as early as now in performance recent iPhones are First Impressions so here in the guys on iPhone 15 Pro Max specifically it's an Apple Store IFC Mall Apple watch from which videos nothing I personally choose the 15 Pro Max because of the difference in terms of the camera pero I'm not saying guys that you should get the 15 Pro Max just because of that that but of course with all the latest gadgets coming out we need a reliable and stable internet connection so let's take a minute to talk about the sponsor of today's video converge my family and I have been users of converge since the past two years it's the perfect home and Business ISP for that seamless internet connection Kaya if you want to get more value and more speed fiber x 1500 pesos to 7499 pesos plan depending on your budget and of course particular needs so apply Now by clicking the link in the description box foreign 15 pro and pro Max are the top models in Apple's iPhone lineup but of course there's more than just a size difference between these two I don't have the iPhone 15 Pro with me right now but I'm pretty sure guys a quick comparison for you guys so yeah expect that this video will be focused so tinaka higher ednella which is the iPhone 15 Pro Max in natural titanium also if you guys are wondering for the regular iPhone 15 and 15 a plus yes we will also be featuring that on our channel on the following days this year young color options must muted from the past years officially guys meron silang natural titanium which is what I have they also have white titanium black titanium and blue titanium actually they are just different shades of neutral fun colors you might want to go for the blue colorway because etoyan Pina a best one among the four but to take note indoors actually iPhone 15 pro and pro Max Outdoors 19 grams that's how many grams lighter the pro and pro Max are compared to canelang predecessors and that is because adding stainless steel and yes it makes a noticeable difference so it's definitely not just for the Aesthetics because it's a camera reason for getting the pro Max smartphone for every day from the past few hours iPhone 15 Pro Max it feels more much more comfortable for a longer period of time so to be specific this 15 Pro Max is 221 grams from the 240 grams last year so yes so now that I'm done describing the biggest upgrade that they should have done 12 years ago is finally have actually the happening just happened the new iPhones are now USBC indicate I'm definitely happy to have it imagine guys Nintendo switch Android phone is held portable Funko a USBC so imagine is for all those things but do take note at an iPhone 15 pro and pro Max and USB 3 compatible you will get faster file transfer speeds USB 10 gbps cable from which Hindi kasama do owns a box so yup USB 2 transfer speeds or editor photographer content creator and many more [Music] no this is where the iPhone 15 Pro Max really shines this has a 6.7 inch size that allows for a bigger battery at chambray at the end of the day we just want an iPhone that will last throughout the day I have yet to test out young battery life iPhone 15 Pro Max because it hasn't been a day yet so yup with that I cannot update you yet but since it now has an a17 Pro chip take note this is a new chipset and is not a presence among a regular iPhone 15 will probably make a difference in terms of its battery life take note it's a three nanometer chipset which is definitely a huge Flex Flagship shop says right now even if these new iPhones guys are already USBC they still can't be charged faster so I'm advice go for you guys is to use a 30 watt charge devices [Music] now I know you guys badly wanna know how the camera performance is technically guys specifications they still have the 48 megapixels is of course the five times telephoto zoomberg iPhone 15 Pro Max will deliver close up shots that are obviously cleaner than what the predecessor is capable or was capable of as you can see this newer 15 Pro Max rendered a window frame better and also a laser noise compared the 14 pro Max also the 24 megapixel photo which is now young default whenever we shoot using the main camera even in a portrait mode it only goes back to 12 megapixels guys and these are 24 millimeter 28 limiter and 35 millimeter focal length options which are effectively 1X 1.2 x and 1.5 x Zoom but according to Apple these are not just digital Zoom since they utilized the new image processing pipeline to produce sharper results also a tongue back on iPhone 15 Pro Max uses a new Tetra prism design wherein it reflects light to expand the distance it travels before reaching the sensor giving it a five times optical zoom Pro Max has a wider Zoom range going from two times optical zoom out and five times optical zoom in Beyond this chambray walang event camera capability differences for Stills they still both have a deep fusion and a photo engine photography May portrait lighting Dental smart hdr5 portraits with focus and depth control night mode supported by lidar and of course the apple raw siguro is on iPhone 15 Pro Max five times optical zoom is of course in terms of the portrait mode subject to background separation apple is calling it next Generation portraits shoot using the normal camera mode the iPhone will use the machine learning to detect people aperture and focus point of your portrait after you've taken the shot which is obviously so useful but do take note most Flagship devices now can already do this and Hindi Lang now the past few years so technically industry but definitely new iPhones [Music] [Applause] now before I totally end this video but again this is just my first impressions so by default guys it lets you silence your phone customize and it turned on your flashlight recording voice memo or open the camera also it only reacts to two kinds of input padding tap or press so by this it can only trigger one feature at a time personally shortcuts like double pressing it or triple pressing Paramus but I think some of the following iPhones into my experience knowing them so yes now that you guys already know how it performed so far the location is should you get the iPhone 15 Pro Max because of the two things I mentioned five times optical zoom and a longer battery life yes as a tech content creator who's talking shampre helpful times five optical zoom concerts for the following months major helpful pogayes shampoo I want to take clear photos and the regular 15 approach so yes that's basically it Sana guys enjoy coyote First Impressions to get myself of course a unit and to go here again it's your Tech girl Mary and see you on our next video bye foreign"

		"captions": "these are videos I usually don't make because I find that controversy surrounding the iPhone release week every year turn out to be more smoke than Fire And there's usually a week of people complaining about small minute things that really don't turn out to be real issues but this year the iPhone 15 Pro seems to be gathering a specific amount of controversy that has tuned up to the point where I have seen countless tweets videos tick tocks you name it discussing all of these issues from the iPhone 15 Pro Max breaking too easily to it thermally getting way too hot and you know people basically blaming issues on the design of the iPhone 15 Pro particularly with Apple's choice to switch over to Titanium instead of using the stainless steel design that they did on the old iPhone 14 pro now listen unlike most people I am here to tell you I don't know everything I don't claim to be the final word on if the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max has issues or maybe even in the future some major design compromise flaw that even hasn't been on Earth yet might come to light and there may be a bunch of issues with this phone but right now I'm just seeing a lot of unqualified opinions floating around the internet and these controversies have boiled over to the point where my own audience is now commenting on my videos or dming me and asking me if they should avoid the purchase of the iPhone 15 Pro because of the current issues and unlike usual Apple iPhone discussions which stay pretty rooted in the Tech Community there's been enough spillover this year that I've seen people like penguin zero who's a pretty popular YouTuber and he only has slightly better hair than me talking about iPhone durability and making spurious yes I do know big words spurious claims that modern Apple products compared to old Apple products meanwhile if you get a modern Apple product there's a chance it stops working within the first week before we even dive into the supposed issues on the iPhone 15 Pro I gotta tackle this argument right away and that's basically the tired argument that things back in the day were built better and listen you can objectively look at this thing you don't have to use personal or anecdotal bias or evidence like he does older iPhones had far more issues than modern day iPhones they didn't last as long they didn't get as much many software updates they were more prone to Breaking the iPhone 4 literally had the biggest quality control Scandal ever on an iPhone with its antenna gate issue and the iPhone 4 strangely enough was also the first iPhone to feature a full glass back and that glass back back then was so prone to shattering uh it was Infamous for it and you know it's it's no coincidence that the iPhone 5 switched to a mostly aluminum back uh just two years after the original iPhone 4 design and if you look at modern day iPhones even this iPhone 15 Pro which people are complaining about the glass back they are objectively much stronger than they were back then so that argument is already done it's not even worth mentioning anymore and also you think you can come over just like that Charlie you can let me tell you something I worked my ass off to get where I am and you think you can take these shortcuts and you think suddenly you're my peer you do what I do because you're funny and you can make people laugh I committed my life to this you don't slide into it like a cheap pair of slippers and reap all the rewards anyway because of all this attention about the iPhone 15 Pro and so many dubious claims I feel obligated to comment on these controversies with my own experience and my own take on what's important because I feel like I should explain the issues with some of these controversies to my viewers to let them know if they are actual issues that you need to be worried about to stop you from purchasing this device first off let's start with durability claims as I believe this one has skyrocketed to the top of the reasons why people are afraid to buy an iPhone 15 Pro they're they're fearful that they're going to buy it and it's going to break it's a reasonable fear to have now of course there's been a few drop test videos uploaded to YouTube already but I think the most infamous video is from jerryrig everything where he does his usual smartphone torture tests uh which every iPhone survived I might know including the iPhone 15 Pro the only one that really failed it was the iPhone 15 Pro Max which had the glass back shatter when he tried to do a bend test now if this little controversy sounds familiar to you it's because this thing is spreading in a similar fashion to the now Infamous iPhone 6 Bengay controversy again I think the glass shattering on the back is probably a Better Built phone than the iPhone 6 bending things weren't necessarily built better back then again just pointing that out there but in general this video has sparked people just reusing this image and talking about how the iPhone 15 Pro is more fragile compared to last year's 14 pro now listen will your iPhone 15 Pro Max glass shatter if you try and physically bend it I don't know but as a normal user I don't think you're ever gonna try and do that normally I discount these bend test videos anyway because no one in the real world is willingly going to take their phone and try and bend it as hard as they can I know I'm not right now even though I'm you know giving you the visual of it and listen most people aren't trained assassins that can kill you just by applying their thumbs to pressure points on your body like Jerry rig everything so that guy has unnatural strength that's a joke now drop tests are usually more of an indication of real world durability we all drop our phones from time to time and there's a fair share of drop test videos out there which also show the glass breaking much easier than the iPhone 14 Pros back now these videos seem pretty reasonable but I do think there's also a flaw with them as well because I think most drop test videos do a poor job usually um showing real world scenarios again of how people drop their phones usually these are you know just phones dropping flat onto concrete and they don't really simulate a lot of the drops most users experience which usually isn't hitting flat concrete over and over and over again it's people just dropping their phones on a table on the carpet on hardwood floor yes on uh cement tube on but on tile on all these different surfaces on different angles hitting all different sorts of things when you drop it I think out of all the drop test videos I watched Mobile reviews eh I hope I'm getting that right covered it the best with a lot more examples of different types of drops that most users would experience on a daily basis and if you watch this entire video in this video you will see the iPhone 15 Pro Glass does actually shatter on the bottom first after about 10 drops but if you look at the repeated drops also on the 14 pro it starts to look worse for wear basically as you go through the video you'll find advantages and disadvantages to the iPhone 15 Pro structural Integrity as well as with the iPhone 14 pro going over how stainless steel and titanium suffer damage but this video kind of illustrates another point that I think rarely gets taken into account with any glass device and that is really it all depends on how you drop your phone and how often you drop your phone you could drop a phone from really high up and literally suffer no damage sometimes but other times you can drop it from your pocket hit a corner or hit a rock the wrong way and all of a sudden your phone glasses just shattered also repeated drops of the phone does weaken the structural Integrity over time so you could drop your phone a few times and it could be perfectly fine look like you never dropped it but you could drop it from a similar height onto a similar surface and it could end up breaking even if it fell the exact same way just because you've dropped your phone so many times you compromised the structural Integrity of the device now is the iPhone 15 Pro less durable than the iPhone 14 pro or the pro Max I think the evidence does say yes particularly for the rear glass don't forget most of these tests had the front glass still intact so I don't think this is an issue solely from just the titanium frame because then both parts of the glass should be compromised in the same way so you might be wondering okay why is the rear glass breaking and the front glass seems to be just as okay as it was on the old iPhone 14 pro and that's the question I ask myself and I really think this has to do with the change that Apple made this year to repairability in short the iPhone 15 Pro is easier to repair this year because the backs are easier to detach they're kind of like not one cohesive unit like they were on the iPhone 14 pro this extra repairability has led to benefits though number one it's now easier to get to the back of the iPhone 15 Pro furthermore it's actually decreased what used to be a very expensive repair cost the iPhone 15 Pro now costs 169 dollars to repair without Apple Care and the back glass for the pro Max cost 200 hundred dollars compare that to the iPhone 14 pro which costs get this 500 to repair the back glass and the iPhone 14 pro Max costs 549 dollars to repair that same back glass now was this more repairable design worth it for the decreased protection it seems that the back glass has I guess that's on who you ask everyone has different priorities but so many people including a lot of the people doing these torture tests have advocated for more repairable iPhone designs and now that they get one they're complaining so it's kind of like you reap what you sow you ask for this stuff it's kind of like the cases like people are like don't use leather Apple then they come out with these new fine woven cases and now everyone's complaining that they're not as good as leather duh duh da da so you could go either way on if this back glass being more fragile is an issue to you but let's talk about the overheating Scandal because I think this one might turn out to be a non-issue so basically we had a lot of people talking about their iPhones overheating after they unboxed it don't forget as I'm making this video this iPhone isn't even a week old yet this is the sixth day that I am using it and most of these complaints stems from the first few days of iPhone unboxing during the initial setup this led some people to conclude that the a17 pro chip ran hot which actually it does it does seem to be true that at Peak Performance it consumes more power than the a16 pro but most people are not using the Peak Performance of the a17 pro chip when they're using their phone for normal tasks like taking video or going through Twitter right and these heat problems really seem to stem from artificial benchmarks another conclusion was that titanium dissipates heat less efficiently than stainless steel which is true and that is what is leading to the compromised thermal design but again I have to question how big of a deal this design decision is considering Apple isn't even using a full titanium frame here it's actually a mix of aluminum and titanium with the titanium just being on the outer side of the device away from the internals where the phone gets hot so realistically I have to ask how much is that thin layer of titanium really holding in all this extra heat I I really don't know and I do want to preface this saying I think we need some more time testing these devices to determine if there is an overheating problem but what I will say is that conducting these tests during the first few days of an iPhone purchase is disingenuous and that's because if you don't know when you first set up an iPhone it is running through a lot of background tasks like syncing your entire iCloud photo library running on device machine learning algorithms to find faces and photos or detecting depth data for editing portrait mode photos or indexing the search data on your phone so you can do Spotlight searches and you're probably also downloading a ton of apps right you just set up a new phone you're downloading all the old apps you had on your old phone and there's just other things that make your phone run hotter than it usually would on a normal day and it also drains your battery significantly during the setup that's why if you ever see someone review battery life on a new device without owning it for a full week you should never fully trust those results especially on day one especially on day one people are reviewing the battery on day one nonsense not to mention most people mentioned they noticed the heat on the first day while also charging their phone while using it all situations I faced in the past that would heat up any iPhone during setup any iPhone any iPhone would heat up during those conditions in fact this iPhone 15 Pro was hot during setup day but I didn't tweet or complain about it because this isn't my first rodeo I know iPhones heat up during the first few days and they drain battery faster during the first few days because of all that setup but now after six days of using this phone it doesn't overheat I've used it in my car for map directions while playing music I've used it to shoot photos and videos I even did a test recording of 4K prores file for 20 minutes I was like okay let me see can I can I overheat this thing and it didn't and others are basically seeing the same thing and Reporting no thermal issue after a few days of use could there be a thermal issue that I and others are not seeing yes it's totally possible like I said at the start I don't pretend to know everything I can only give you my own results from using these devices how I use them and as a blanket statement new designs usually aren't a complete net good or a net bad there's pros and cons to the way that things are designed and there's benefits like lower repair costs and there's disadvantages like the back of the glass maybe being easier to break than previous years ultimately as the customer you have the power to determine if those issues are real issues for you and if they are don't buy the product if they aren't and in if you're real World experience you aren't facing these issues then don't be scared of the product either and again if you are facing any of these problems and you're like my iPhone's overheating I don't know what Greg's talking about it's it's awful the camera's awful the titanium's scratched I I hate this phone then don't listen to me either go return the device right now when you still can don't hold on to the thing if you don't like it now to me this iPhone after using it for about a week it has a lot of benefits to the new design that I like even if I'm willing to make some of those trade-offs it's lighter it's more comfortable to hold the titanium looks great it feels great in the hands and this phone is Snappy and responsive with that a17 Pro chip and I really like the camera things I don't like about it are battery life which I'm hesitant to even really give a full opinion on right now because again I haven't used this for a full week just like I told you to be wary of but if you want to know my own personal experience with this iPhone 15 Pro Max battery is basically it's about the same as my 14 pro Max which did get me through a full day of usage but it didn't leave much room to spare and as the battery started to age on the 14 pro Max and it got less and less at the end of the day to the point where when you get to like 90 battery capacity maybe you have to charge it halfway through the day so for the 15 Pro Max I was hoping for better battery life so that wouldn't happen as the battery aged I'm not really seeing that so far in the 15 Pro Max seems to be about the same battery life as I was getting last year all right but what is the main point of this video listen I consider myself to be an apple Enthusiast I like Apple products I like a lot of other products too a good product is a good product and I judge them as I would any product because ultimately my allegiance is to you the viewer and also to my own personal Integrity myself if I recommend a product like this iPhone and it sucks and you have a terrible time with it and it snaps in half when you touch it wrong or it overheats and burns your hand like a McDonald's coffee why would you ever watch any of my videos ever again if I ever recommended a defective product like that I have no reason to lie to you about my own personal experience with this device and if I did lie to you it would only be to my own detriment I don't even have a personal connection with apple as a company they don't send me devices they don't pay me I pay them I buy all of these products every year and I don't return most of them it's an expense for this channel but what I do care about is accurate information and not jumping to conclusions for some reason I still care about integrity in a world that seems to care less and less about it it would probably be more beneficial for me if I jump to conclusions like everyone else out there to get more attention to get more views to Hype up these controversies to the point where you have reaction streamers reacting to them because we live in a fast-paced society and we move from controversy to controversy in days and because of that people forget people forget what you said and there's less and less accountability every day people want what happened to Lou they want 78 million views generated on an iPhone video that talks about how bad it is and people fall into that trap easily they make one video about the iPhone having an issue and suddenly they start getting views and then they make another video and it doesn't get views and that suddenly they go oh wait the when I talked about the iPhone stinking it got abuse so maybe I should do that again it happens I've seen it happen to multiple channels because iPhones like it or not they're a big topic for people who like Apple products and for people who don't like Apple products now to be fair that's not everyone there's a lot of credible and trusted channels out there but it is a big enough issue that I do see it and it warrants at least warning my viewers to get a second opinion and I say this even for my channel don't watch a Greg's gadgets video on an iPhone review and think that is it that is the definitive opinion that is the definitive review it is the best review ever it got nothing wrong no listen I am human I may have missed something I may have got something wrong I make mistakes all the time to get a really good idea of how a device works or if there's issues with it you should watch a few reviews from different channels and then make up your own mind because ultimately you the viewer are what matters it is your opinion it is your experience with these devices that matters if you have a bad experience with it or a good experience with it trust your gut okay let me have it in the comments I know I'm gonna get the usual right Apple Fanboy apple pays you Apple Defender all The Usual Suspects because it's another year it's another iPhone release and if you have even a slightly different opinion even though I think this video is pretty fair people get upset they're like why you don't completely agree with me Greg I'm upset at you you stink Greg cut your hair Greg style your hair differently Greg do this Greg do that Greg Greg Greg Greg I get it I get it I'm human why you gotta criticize me all the time why you gotta make fun of the way I say button button you don't think I see those comments I see all the comments criticizing me all the time you think it you think it doesn't affect me it doesn't I don't care keep criticizing me I like it I don't care it's YouTube you gotta have a thick skin to be in this game I got the thickest skin it's a little too thick I could afford to lose a little bit of weight that's a criticism I criticize myself all right have a good day I'll see you in the next one guys I love you"

		"captions": "I've been using the iPhone 15 over the past week and while it isn't perfect this is one of the biggest year-over-year upgrades that Apple has given to a base model iPhone in a very long time when you first open up the box the first thing that strikes you is just how soft it is that's honestly the best way to describe it especially if you've held an iPhone from the past few years the edges have been ever so slightly rounded and the back glass is this really soft matte texture that feels Pleasant to hold it's one of the nicest feeling phones that I've ever held actually and I'm not exaggerating at all the only thing I don't like about this design update is the color or rather the lack of color Apple calls this green and don't get me wrong I like green as you can clearly see but this iPhone is the color of my white shoes after I mow the lawn and that is not a good thing also in the Box you get a braided USB type-c cable for our brand new USBC iPhone 15. thank you Europe if we flip the phone over to the front you can see that we get the dynamic Island from the the iPhone 14 pro last year and this is actually a big upgrade for me all of the notifications now pop up and expand from there with lots of little neat animations and it also does have quite a bit of functionality attached to it with music playing and timers and whatnot yes it might feel a little bit gimmicky at first but there's one thing this island allows for that makes the whole thing worth it for me seamless custom icons because that shortcut pop-up now happens inside the dynamic Island you can have custom icons on the home screen without that annoying shortcut pop-up coming up if you want a tutorial on how to do this let me know in a comment down below the display has also been upgraded it now tops out at 1 000 nits of brightness for SDR content and then 2 000 nits of brightness with HDR and it is noticeably brighter outside I used it for navigation a ton on my trip this past weekend and I never had a problem seeing the screen even in direct sunlight the display is still running at 60 hertz though the high refresh rate displays have once again been saved for the pro model phones this year but that's totally fine this is a perfectly good display for most people the colors and contrast are fantastic and the stereo speakers are great as well the biggest upgrade though can you guess what it is well you're thinking about that USBC Port aren't you eh wrong it's actually the camera system the iPhone 15 gets the 48 megapixel main camera from the iPhone 14 pro which is actually huge I took a ton of photos and videos on my little trip over the past weekend and I was very impressed at the kind of images that you can get with this base model iPhone 15. the photos were sharp had very accurate colors for the most part and there was very minimal shutter lag present when pressing the capture button even in places where lighting wasn't the best the iPhone 15 still did pretty great and the Cinematic mode from the front-facing camera looks very solid too this Aviation Museum that I went to was incredible there were a ton of planes from many different eras and even when there wasn't a ton of light the iPhone 15 performed admirably there's some new software features too for example if I take a regular photo of something I can actually choose to turn it into a portrait mode photo later on the iPhone 15 will actually capture all of the depth information required in every single shot that you take so that you can change things up on the Fly after the fact that is awesome and it's something I think a lot of people will take advantage of apple has also given us a 2X option inside the camera app despite the fact that there's no telephoto in this phone because the main sensor is now a much higher resolution you can crop into it digitally without much of a loss it's definitely a good option to have but as you can see if you zoom in any further there there's a pretty big loss of detail it's certainly no substitute for Apple's new 5x Tetra prism telephoto lens that the pro Max gets this year the other two cameras on this phone the 12 megapixel ultrawide and the 12 megapixel front-facing camera have not been updated at least near as I can tell but image processing as a whole is going to be better because the iPhone 15 comes with the a16 bionic chip that was in the iPhone 14 pro last year and by this point I think you're starting to see a bit of a trend this is basically the iPhone 14 pro plus or minus a few things you get the dynamic Island the brighter screen the main camera and the a16 bionic from last year's profile you are losing the 120 hertz part of the display and the telephoto camera but you're gaining USBC and the new design unfortunately the USBC port in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 plus is limited to the exact same speeds as the lightning Port was so USB 2 speeds transferring files via cable is still going to be a pain wired charging is also pretty slow Apple claims that you're going to get like 50 of your battery back after 30 minutes on the charger and how is the old battery anyway well Apple didn't talk a lot about it in the keynote which led me to believe that it wasn't going to be very good and I wish I wasn't but I was kinda right if I have a busy day where I'm using the cameras a lot or I'm using the phone for navigation a ton I will definitely need to plug in and charge up before my day is over magsafe does make that a little bit easier with the plethora of magsafe battery packs that are available now but I still do wish that there was a bigger battery stuffed into here the iPhone 15 is a big upgrade over last year's 14. I actually think it's the biggest upgrade since the iPhone 12 and they're keeping the price the same this year it starts at 7.99 USD if you skipped upgrading to the 14 last year because it was a bit of an iterative update this actually might be the year for you to buy I do have a review coming on the iPhone 15 Pro as well so subscribe if you haven't already hope you liked the video thanks for watching and as always have a great day"

		"captions": "Apple's using Titanium on their newest iPhone 15 Pro Max titanium is the coolest metal on the planet for many reasons it's bio-compatible used for creating artificial joints repairing human bones not to mention build Interstellar spacecraft and to construct robots that crawl other planets and of course it's on my ring my ring has titanium that I reclaimed from a wheelchair titanium comes in quite a few different flavors grade 1 being the cheapest softest and easiest machine which is what I thought the iPhone was going to be but then Apple slapped a grade 5 on the screen and I got rocked in more ways than one and let me show you why foreign titanium bar stock laying around as people often do this guy costs 170 dollars for example this 6061 aluminum bar of the exact same proportions only cost me 10. aluminum is what smartphones are normally made from and the color difference between the two metals is glorious to behold especially as it's heated the main reason my Jerry rig knife is only 15 bucks is because I'm using an aluminum alloy and not a titanium alloy and keep in mind this solid Rod is only grade 2 titanium I'm too poor to buy a full Rod of grade 5 titanium since a single notepad sized paper thick sliver already cost 106 dollars all by itself if we do some simple math and scale this half millimeter thick piece of metal up to a hypothetical eight and a half millimeter block thick enough to Mill a phone out of we would be looking at almost two thousand dollars worth of grade 5 titanium and that's not even including the complexity of milling and shaping grade 5 and the dollars worth of iPhone Hardware that goes inside so the math just ain't mathon and there's no way Apple suddenly decided to make negative profit on each iPhone sold you might have noticed that titanium reacts in a very unique way as it gets torched oxidizing an extremely predictable and consistent rainbows going from yellow to purple to blue to light blue and back to gray again as it gets really hot you might be thinking to yourself hey Jerry are you even gonna unbox the iPhone and I say yes let's jump in and see what this iPhone is made from and also how well it can handle the uh the heat of everyday life hit that subscribe button if you haven't already and let's get started [Music] [Applause] [Music] inside the brand new iPhone 15 Pro max box we find the phone itself this blue titanium is almost the same shade as the blue titanium that I made looking under the phone this time we find there's no lightning cable instead we have a brand new braided USBC cable I imagine the world will soon follow Apple's lead on this one and we'll start seeing this port everywhere probably the closest thing we'll ever see to world peace and honestly the phone does feel good about the same as any other rectangular phone but the brushed titanium and the etch back glass do feel super cool but the imitation blue shade is just ever so much off from the actual shade of blue titanium that I think it would bother me long term Apple said again that this screen glass is the strongest glass ever on a smartphone they call it ceramic shield and I agree it is a pretty solid slab of glass we know see plastic screen scratch at a level two or three blasts at five or six and Sapphire would be an eight or nine this dual ion exchange ceramic Shield does still scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7 but level 6 does appear to be quite a bit more faint than usual and I do think apple is onto something with this proprietary glass the front selfie camera is tucked into the dynamic Island and is protected by that same slab of glass the earpiece is a razor thin slit between the glass and the frame no speaker grilles to fall out or get dirty making our way over to the titanium sides apples using something called a PVD coating a physical vapor deposition it's a pretty wild method of applying an ultra thin protective layer over the titanium I don't know enough about PVD to talk about it in depth but you know it is scratchable exactly like the anodized aluminum everything except for this 5G antenna slot for some reason this oval is just not scratching I think they should make a whole phone out of whatever this stuff is the power button is scratchable however and not removable along with the top and entire left side it took Apple 14 hours to apply this finish and my Jerry rig knife 14 seconds to unapply the Finish the new action button is scratchable and our USBC Port down near the bottom is an actual USB 3 with 10 gigabit transfer speeds the regular iPhone 15 is just USB 2 and if you don't know what that means you'll be just fine with either the matte back glass which every phone should have does not scratch the Apple logo in the center is the only thing that's smooth one thing that Apple did change up quite a bit this year is with the cameras we still get that gradual gradient built into the tinted glass that rises up to the camera plateau and some of these camera upgrades we won't be able to see until the teardown but Apple says these three lenses that we can see are actually seven got a LOL a bit of that absolute stretch here at the bottom we have a 48 megapixel main camera which apparently has a nano scale coating on the lens to reduce glare the coating luckily does not scratch off or fracture the coolest camera is definitely the middle one a 12 megapixel 5 times Tetra prism telephoto lens that redirects and reflects light four times before hitting a 3D sensor shift OAS stabilizer if there's one reason to take apart the iPhone 15 Pro Max it's to see what in the world that looks like from the inside then up top we have a 12 megapixel ultrawide apparently these two cameras on the edge can work together like two eyeballs to generate spatial video which I don't want to be the guy to beat a dead horse but that was something Android did 12 years ago with the HTC EVO 3D probably before some of you kidlets with iPhones were even born gotta honor your ancestors Apple said during their event that the back glass panel is easily removable to facilitate repairability which is a huge commendable move and then in the same sentence Apple said that the internal structure of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is made from 100 recycled aluminum which immediately tells us two things one it's nice to see that there's more than just the iPhone design that gets recycled every year and two the internal frame is not solid grade 5 titanium only the exterior this explains quite a bit the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a 6.7 inch OLED display with 2 000 nits of outdoor brightness and 120 hertz refresh rate and lasts for about Infinity seconds before having no reaction to my lighter nice work Apple we'll try out my uh big boy lighter in a second it's time to see if the new Blended aluminum titanium grafted hybrid structure compromises the structural Integrity of the iPhone 15 Pro Max yeah I'm gonna be honest I did not see that one coming you've been watching me durability test smartphones for about 11 years now and most phones do not break iPhones especially do not break like ever and that snap was abnormally quick kinda stunned I'm not sure if it's because the grade 5 titanium frame has nearly three times more tensile strength than aluminum or half the elasticity but the glass did not like being pressed or flexed by my thumb that's crazy on the first bin too internally the phone itself is doing fine of course there's no cracking or shattering of the frame but the back glass is definitely obliterated good thing Apple made the glass modular so it only cost 200 bucks to replace instead of 500 but still if I was a person who just purchased a twelve hundred dollar titanium iPhone 15 Pro Max I would be extremely nervous right now anyway I did not plan on that happening but you gotta admit the crack looks pretty cool the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max does not survive my durability test which means it's time for the big boy lighter the PVD coating is already an imitation blue which would make any actual doing the titanium brain very difficult to see but if we sand it down and expose some bearish titanium we might be able to see if Apple's grade 5 reacts the same way as my grade 5. that's some pretty good looking brush titanium still not sure why it takes Apple 14 hours I'm using a map gas torch which I think along with burning my desk is actually lighting some of the titanium dust on fire you can see the Sparks glow white as they sputter away from the phone now the titanium itself could probably handle the heat but the screen and the phone circuitry not so much the torch definitely accomplishes what my lighter could not and if we look super close at the iPhone frame we can see it start to change colors from the heat apple is indeed using real titanium is it grade 5 though I do have ways of finding out I think it's getting kind of hot in here and now everyone knows the whole point of getting a new iPhone is so that everyone knows you have a new iPhone hiding it in a black plastic case would holy and entirely defeat the purpose and wow side note natural titanium is the move for sure however getting a transparent case to show off your phone is dangerous since most clear cases are made of thermoplastic polyurethane which when exposed to ultraviolet radiation undergoes the irreversible process of photooxidation sunlight makes clear cases turn yellow so on the off chance you ever do go outside you won't have a clear case anymore enter my channel sponsor dbrand dbrand has inexplicably found a way to defeat the sun with their never yellowing completely transparent ghost case and they're offering free Replacements if it ever does yellow which is pretty brave of them the best part is the ghost case is also completely compatible with my tear down skin you can keep your own phone from getting absolutely wrecked like mine with the link down in the description now I pride myself on being extremely thorough and I'd be a Miss if we let this golden opportunity to check the back glass the regular iPhone 15 Pro for similar structural deficiencies as its larger counterpart with some very strong bins from the back nothing happens flipping the phone over to the front again nothing happens the normal sized iPhone 15 Pro survives and does not have the same fate as the max I'm curious to see how thin Apple's titanium layer actually is and what grade it is the iPhone 15 Pro Max teardown is going to be quite a bit more destructive than usual thank you for subscribing and thank you for watching I'll see you around"

		"captions": "five reasons you should not buy the new iPhone 15. number one they actually got more expensive the new iPhone 15 Pro Max got bumped up an extra hundred dollars this year as if they're not already expensive enough number two all the colors are super underwhelming this year the titanium is kind of a mix of like gray trying to be gold and all of the other colors are borderline just white three all of the differences are super minor barely noticeable at all the only thing we really got was some random button that nobody really asked for reason number four is that the camera is hardly even better and it still takes pretty grainy pictures to me and last but not least reason number five why you absolutely should not buy the iPhone 15 is because they are absolutely impossible to get a hold of because they're all sold out because I already bought all of them"

		"captions": "the iPhone 15 is only a few days away so as it's been the tradition for about 10 years now Welcome to our final leaks and rumors covering everything we know from the lineup to the design to the display the camera all the way down to the price so here's all the info on the iPhone 15 right after our sponsor incognate your information is sold online and it will take years to get every website and every app to delete your data but luckily incognate can do this for you simply set up an account grant them the right to help you and see the progress on their website go to incognito.comtech and get 60 off their annual plan okay so when it comes to this year's lineup just like last year we're expecting four iPhone models two standard models the iPhone 15 and 15 plus and two Pro Models the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max now their standard models are inheriting a lot of the features from last year's Pro Models whereas the pro models of this year these get the new features for 20 23 with the biggest ones being reserved for the 15 Pro Max alone reason why some of the rumors were even pointing towards it being called the iPhone 15 Ultra in terms of the design the standard models are having their frame updated for the first time since the iPhone 12s with a more rounded frame towards the edges that makes them more comfortable to hold in the hand and I could confirm that based on our dummy units both the 15 and the 15 plus feel far better in the hand you don't get that short match feel like you did with the 14s and prior so yeah I do quite like this change the thickness is also increasing to 7.81 millimeters from 7.79 although this isn't really noticeable at all thanks to the rounded Corners also the rounded Corners aren't really making them any less grippy so that's another plus another design change with the standard models are the new colors So based on the leaks we should see a brand new orange as well as a brand new blue with a purple and the red apparently going away now when it comes to the Pro Models that rounded frame is coming too I however this is said to be made out of titanium rather than stainless steel light before which would not only make them lighter but also more durable and there is a good chance that Apple could be using a brushed titanium texture similar to the Apple watch Ultra meaning that fingerprints should not be an issue anymore now with the Pro Models apple is tweaking the dimensions quite a bit so the iPhone 15 Pro is getting shorter and also narrower and I'm just holding it in the hand against the 14 pro the difference is very noticeable the 15 Pro feels more Compact and compared to hold the 15 Pro Max on the top right here is also shorter and narrower than the 14 pro Max by quite a considerable amount I've always complained about how uncomfortable the pro Max was for me because of the wide body and the sharp frame well I'm pleased to say that at least from the dummy units that we have this issue is 100 sold the 15 Pro Max feels significantly more comfortable and it is truly something that I could use on a daily basis and just like the standard models the Pro Models are getting thicker too 8.5 millimeters on the dumb units compared to 7.85 on the 14 Pros so yeah pretty big increase here which will make more sense later in the video another fairly significant design change on the Pro Models is the mute switch which is being replaced by a customizable action button just like on the Apple watch Ultra so we'll be able to assign certs and apps to that button as well as certain functions such as quickly launching the camera app one of my most requested features on an iPhone or setting an alarm or changing between the focus modes and so on I'm also pretty sure that we'll be able to double press it too and maybe even hold it to enable a second or third function as well of course that muting your phone would likely still be possible as one of those options and lastly the Pro Models are getting some new colors too there's a new blue that's rumored to look very similar to the 12 Pro specific blue and also a brand new gray which I two pipe like although I think I'm still gonna go with either the space gray or the blue this year so now what about the display play well the standard models will be getting the dynamic Island from the 14 Pros last year and really the best part about this is that this will push more and more developers to make use of the dynamic Island in fact Google is working on an update for Google Maps to take advantage of the dynamic islands and more developers would follow suit then the bezels are getting significantly thinner on the Pro Models by about half compared to the 14 Pros making them the thinnest bezels on any smartphone out right now and I also predict that Apple would once again improve the brightness levels at least on the standard models as there is currently a very significant brightness difference between the four teens and the 14 Pros so what about the cameras well the standard models are rumored to come with the exact same 48 megapixel sensor that we got with the iPhone 14 Pros last year and that would indeed make sense as Apple has done the same with the iPhone 14s and the 13s they gave them the previous gems Pros cameras now even though the sensor would be the same as on the 14 Pros it doesn't mean that we'll get the same camera quality and features and that's because in the past Apple has restricted prores video and pro Raw photos to just the Pro Models only and I suspect this being the case again this year what this means is that you won't be able to take 48 megapixel Raw photos like you could with the iPhone 14 Pros with all photos being permanently bent to 12 megapixels now you might be able to get around this by using a third-party app like halide but we're not fully sure yet if that would work or not something that could work though would be that 2x sensor crop Zoom that Apple added to the 14 Pros last year giving the non-pro models optical zoom for the very first time on the pro side there are two big changes that are rumored the first is a much larger Sony sensor close to one inch in size that could give us a similar level of camera quality as the xiaomi 13 Ultra the Oppo Find X6 Pro and many more with a superb depth of field incredible low light performance and overall much better camera results than what we could get from the 14 Pros last year however only the 15 Pro Max is set to feature this new sensor so no one really knows if the 15 Pro will see any changes in terms of the camera or not as the second big change is also rumored to be a 15 Pro Max exclusive and that is the new Periscope Zoom module if you've seen our previous videos you probably know what this is It's essentially Apple bringing us high levels of optical zoom above 3x to better compete with Samsung Google Oppo and all the other major manufacturers according to our rumors we should get a 5 to 6X optical zoom lens however the amount of lossless Zoom could be higher depending on the resolution of the sensor that Apple uses if Apple were to use a 48 megapixel sensor combined with that 5x optical zoom lens they could achieve a similar level of Zoom to the Google pixel 7 Pro which was already very close to the current champion the S3 Ultra which features a 10 X optical zoom lens but with a low resolution 10 megapixel sensor aside from this the lighter module is said to be getting upgraded to one that could offer more range and all iPhone 15s are rumored to come with a 7 element lens system for the main module with one Glass lens and six plastic lenses for a Sharper Image in general up until now all lenses were made out of plastic and xiaomi was the only manufacturer who had an actual Glass lens in there moving on to the performance the standard iPhone 50 models are getting upgraded to the a16 chip from the 14 pros of last year while the Pro Models are getting the brand new chip for 2023 the a17 the a17 is a pretty big deal as it is said to be Apple's first chip to be manufactured on a three nanometer process this is coming from the a16's five nanometer process which even though Apple T's S4 it is technically still 5. and what a switch to three nanometer means is that we would get both more performance as well as a lower power consumption than the a16 chip which could improve the battery life which I'll talk about more in just a bit aside from this the clock speeds are also said to be increased from 3.46 gigahertz to 3.7 which is a significant upgrade from one generation to another the ram is also remembered to get bumped to 8 gigabytes from six on the Pro Models however we have had some contradictory reports too so this isn't certain yet although I do hope that Apple does make this change as the RAM management just hasn't been great on the past few iPhones so what about new features well the biggest new feature is really to switch from lightning to USB type c a switch that took only 11 years um to happen and it is only happening because the EU is forcing Apple to do so USBC will be both on the standard and on the pro models with the only exception being that the standard models will be limited to USB 2.0 speeds while the Pro Models are rumored to be getting Thunderball speeds of up to 40 gigabits per second or 83 times faster than USB 2.0 this will of course facilitate all of those prores and infloride transfers which were just a pain in the past but I do believe that we might also get some exclusive features because of this like who knows maybe we will be able to use our iPhones as external storage for our MacBooks that would be awesome yeah we'll have to wait and see but you will need to buy a separate cable for that and apple is rumored to be selling a short Thunderbolt cable specifically for the Pro Models also all cables are now said to be color matched to the color of your iPhone from the leaked images that we've seen it seems like the cables are also braided for extra durability and also longer at 1.5 meters as opposed to one on top of this there are a couple of extra features reubert the Wi-Fi standard is said to be upgraded to iPhone 6E from Wi-Fi 6 with about 2.4 gigabits per second transfer speeds from 1.2 assuming that you also have a Wi-Fi 6C router there's also said to be a new ultroid band chip to help it communicate with the Apple Vision Pro headset better once that releases next year the 5G modem is being upgraded to qualcomm's brand new x70 chip with a better range change lower product consumption and also lower latency and apple is also remembered to be removing the SIM tray in some regions outside of the us too with France the UK the EU and dozens of other countries being potential contenders now when it comes to battery we are said to be getting some pretty major battery size increases here so all batteries are getting bigger by 18 and 13 on the standard models and 14 and 12 on the Pro Models this is why those bodies are thicker to accommodate those larger batteries and I do hope that these larger batteries in combination with a 39 meter chip would give us the best iPhone batteries yet something that I've been struggling with heavily with my 14 pro the charging speeds are also rumored to be increased to potentially 35 Watts up from the current 27 Watts that we're getting on the Pro Models however you will need a more powerful charger than the current 20 watt one that apple is selling so I do expect Apple to introduce a brand new charger if they do indeed include support for 35 watts and wireless charging is also rumored to be improved with the addition of the new G2 standard or qi2 standard which would allow you to get 15 watts wireless charging speeds from third-party Chargers like you wouldn't be restricted to using maxif anymore currently if you're using a third-party charger you are limited to 7.5 Watts maximum and then we have the price the 15 and the 15 plus are set to remain the same at 800 and 900 for the base 128 gig models which is a fairly decent price although I would still recommend someone get a refurbished 14 pro or 14 pro Max instead which you will be able to get for about the same price as these and they would also come with more features such as the 120hz displays with always on that are also brighter the 3x optical zoom lens the better ultrawide the macro and so on the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max on the other hand are set to increase in price by about a hundred dollars or even more than that outside of the US the base model is rumored to get bumped to 256 so so in case you were looking to get the 256 model then the price should be the same as last year and then the highest end model would now be bumped into terabytes uh rather than just one in terms of when you'll be able to buy these uh as you probably know the event is next week on the 12th uh that Friday is usually when the pre-order starts and the following Friday so the 22nd is when they should be shipping I should also mention that the release date for the 15 Pro Max is said to be delayed by about three to four weeks due to production issues which makes sense as this model is indeed the one that gets the most amount of changes all in all I'm pretty excited for the iPhone 15 lineup especially since I'll be switching to the pro Max model this year to get all of those extra camera features but yeah let me know your thoughts what do you think of the entire iPhone 15 lineup and definitely stay tuned for our live stream of the Apple events and you can hang out with us you can talk to us and yeah we'll be watching the event together so stay tuned for that which is on Tuesday the 12th and also stay tuned for that big reveal that we'll have very soon I'm Daniel this has been sitting off Tech and I'll see you guys in the next one signing out cheers [Music] foreign"

		"captions": "hey guys Anton Tech Chap and I'm filming this entire review on the new iPhone 15 pro and pro Max so let me know what you make of it does it look like it's been shot on iPhone and actually if I show you what I'm looking at you can see this is my producer James with the 15 Pro recording his new 4k 60 prores onto an SSD plugged into the USB port so for me actually the new USB C Port is incredibly helpful because I can transfer files off we're talking like 10 gigs per minute at 4k60 Pro is plug it in your laptop and Away you go but as well as being able to shoot 4K 60 prores for the first time on new iPhone 15 Pros you can also Now record in HDR and log now I still don't think an iPhone is going to replace your fancy mirrorless or DSLR camera but you know often the best camera is the one you have in your pocket it's a good tool to have although I would be it's kind of surprised if my I don't know professional wedding videographer turned up to my wedding shooting on an iPhone but with the new options you have with the higher quality video and photos which we'll come back to in a second oh I just got bright it's a pretty big step up anyway enough about prores the headline upgrade with the new 15 series is the switch to USBC the ubiquity the universality of USBC how every MacBook iPad well except the cheapest 9th gen model every Windows laptop Android phone and every charging port in new cars they're all type c and while you could faff around with adapters or just rely on wireless charging and airdrop going forward it means if you run out of battery on your iPhone 15 and your friends or Android then you can use the same charging cable and vice versa now I had hoped the switch to USBC may have meant we'd also get faster charging but alas no still tops out 20 watts with Apple's charger which of course doesn't come bundled in the Box although you do get the nice CTC braided cable now and also the regular 15s not the pros actually have a USB 2.0 spec rather than 3.0 so the same speed as the old lining connector so it feels like a little half-hearted sort of switch to USBC although there are other benefits obviously we've got this transfer of footage that I'm recording prores on right now also you can now output to a TV or monitor at 4 4K 60 HDR previously topped out at 1080p 30 although I'm not sure if Apple made this switch out of the pure goodness of their heart so everything could be Universal and lovely I think it had something to do with the EU regulations coming in next year which kind of forced them to switch to USBC if they wanted to keep selling these phones in Europe but regardless of why they did it it is certainly a nice upgrade it will take a minute for Apple's accessories to catch up only the airpods Pro 2 have been refreshed with a USBC case all other airpods the Max's Apple's power bank and obviously still their Mac peripherals only updating but I suspect that'll happen pretty quickly and I'm also excited by all the new third-party accessories and charges coming out that will work with well everything but there's a lot more here than just USBC and some fancy video options although I'll come back to the camera in just a second let's talk about this design and while on the face of it not a whole lot has changed in the last well four years I guess since the iPhone 11 Pro with the most obvious refresh being last year's Dynamic Island which I'm pleased to see has made its way to the regular iPhone 7 scenes now and it is a genuinely useful little notification bar especially as more apps have now been optimized to use it I'll tell you what though the first thing you notice how much lighter this is the 15 Pros have a new titanium band Around The Edge and together with an aluminum frame inside actually reduces The Weight by 19 grams 240 221 and particularly with the pro Max which is a pretty chunky phone it is a very welcome upgrade they've also slimmed down the bezels and it means they've been able to reduce the overall size of the phone it's almost a millimeter narrower and shorter although it is about half a millimeter thicker but they've maintained the same 6.1 and 6.7 inch screen sizes Apple have also slightly contoured just the corners of the frame here on the back so it's a little bit smoother and sits in your hand a bit more comfortably although it is quite subtle and as someone who used the 14 pro Max as their main phone for most of last year these changes do add up to make it just a little bit more comfortable to use we also get a couple of new colors this is the natural titanium which for my money I think is the best new flavor it's kind of of Stony grayish color we also get a dark blue a black and a white although more importantly they've actually redesigned the Intel frame and layout of the 15 Pros so the back glass can now be repaired much more easily and crucially much more cheaply than before I've also just realized this is going to be my 1 000th video on YouTube we're at 999 this is my next video holy moly a thousand videos if you haven't already subscribed I feel like now is a pretty good time let's see what happens over the next thousand videos I'm gonna be so old anyway back to the iPhone and let's talk about this action button it is still a mute switch by default you just long press it to change between loud and silent and the dynamic Island will also react to the change and if you are muted you'll also be able to see the icon at the top left of the screen but now you can customize it to do pretty much anything torch voice recording launch an app although I reckon for most of us myself included you'll just make it the shortcut for the camera and then it also acts as a shutter button yes the volume down does also work as a shutter but you can do anything with it really and I also appreciate that you can use this to toggle on or off a lot of accessibility settings I think for some people this will be a really big deal don't get too close to me when I'm cooking babe I'm playing a preview of Resident Evil Village using what I'm told are PS4 assets natively on the 15 Pro Max albeit at 720p and 30fps and well low to medium settings but still for our phone this is incredible and for now at least it's only possible with the new Apple a17 Pro chip that powers the new 15 pro and pro Max which also happens to be the first three nanometer architecture chip we've had on a mobile we're also going to have the likes of Resident Evil 4 remake death stranding the division Resurgence and even next year Assassin's Creed Mirage which is the first time a full console version of an Assassin's game will be on mobile definitely recommend a controller though this is the backbone one for Playstation Android although they do now sell an iOS USBC version for the iPhone 15 highly recommend because playing Resident Evil village with the virtual touchscreen controls isn't ideal so it's all pretty exciting because yes we have the usual 10 bump in processor performance we actually get double the neural engine performance but these these are kind of just abstract upgrades that we see year on year and really make a noticeable difference but the reason the a17 pro is called the pro is because of this completely redesigned Graphics chip the GPU which is not only a lot more powerful but supports features like Hardware Ray tracing which isn't new you're right the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the flagship Dimension 9200 I believe is from mediatek they both support Hardware Ray tracing actually we're going to have new versions of both those chips like next month so they will compete with the a17 pro hopefully it means more developers will actually make use of it in their games now as strong as these new titanium frame phones are they can still break they can still fall out your pocket off tables so I've teamed up with the lovely folks over at caseify who have sent me a whole range of new cases to protect my iPhones so case if I have refreshed their lineup for the new iPhone 15 and 15 pros and I've got three of the most popular models here I've got the impact the bounce and their brand new ultrabounce each tougher than the last and in case you're wondering uh yeah my real name is Tom and not the tech Jab and what I really do like about caseify is how they combine the creativity and the personality of their cases I mean there are literally so many options to choose from and you can customize your own with proper tough protection in fact all case defy protective cases are aligned with their Eco shock material which increases protection and also makes them able to absorb more of the shock if you happen to be a little bit clumsy and knock your phone off your desk over and over and over again and actually the impact case meets the 4X military grade we get 5x on the ultra impact six on the bounce and a whopping 10x on the ultra bounce which is the strongest case they have ever created and it also has a built-in lens protector for the camera you can literally drop this thing from over 30 feet and maybe I will but I'll save that for my next video just make sure you pair a case to find case with a screen protector though because even if your phone survives a fall you don't want that screen to be scratched so they're tough they look good and case if I are making their products even more sustainable and environmentally friendly than ever so before you're showing your iPhone arrives click my link in the description below to get 15 off your next order at caseify Now versus last year's 14 Pros the new 15 Pro and Promax get an extra two gigs of RAM so we're now up to eight gigabytes and of course we have that new a17 Pro chip replacing the a16 bionic and in this 3dmark Wildlife extreme test we're looking at around a 25 optic in performance although in this new solar Bay Benchmark which includes Ray tracing it's 44 faster however if we switch back but run the 20 minute stress test the stability is lower the new chip throttles more although it's still eight percent faster even at its lowest score but you can also see the 15 Pro Max lost 5 of its battery versus just two percent on the 14 pro Max during this test although we'll talk more about battery in just a second but actually even versus last year's 14 pro Max which is to say I've been using pretty much every day this does feel noticeably nippier more responsive apps seem to load Just a Touch quicker and also I haven't had any of those sort of random slowdowns or stuff says that did occasionally crop up on my 14 pro it's also a big deal because the 15 Pros are the only phones for now at least that will run these upcoming console level games this does now support Wi-Fi 6E although you will of course need a compatible 6E router to make best use of it but overall I would say it's a solid step up and with the new graphics chip along with USBC it makes this one of the most future-proof iPhones we've had in years okay before we dive into the camera which I know you're waiting to see I just want to mention the battery life because we didn't see the much rumored increase in battery size but for the first time the 15 support the G2 standard so if you have a new G2 wireless charger or power bank that can now match the magsay's 15 watts double the previous 7.5 which is a nice little upgrade and actually even though Apple claim the new 15 series will have the same battery as the 14 series that's not been quite my experience so far after an hour of YouTube an hour of tick tock half an hour of gaming and 15 minutes of shooting 4k60 both the 15 pro and pro Max were three percentage points lower than the 14 pro and pro Max all phones with 100 battery capacity and actually bought these two 14 Pros last week so they're all brand new like the 15s although more importantly what I'm very keen to see is how the battery health fares over time because my iPhone 14 pro Max which I've been using for a year is down to 88 of its battery health now to be fair other Brands don't really share that information so there's not a lot to compare it to but I do know versus previous iPhones I've used for a long time that degradation in battery capacity is a lot faster it's more significant so I'm hoping there's improvements with this obviously it'll take a while to figure that out trying to get a photo no more I'm out if I bring up the camera specs for both you can see the main Hardware change this year is that the optical zoom with the pro Max is getting a new five times telephoto whereas the pro is sticking with three times aside from that the hardware is pretty similar same sensors and same resolutions as last year's 14 Pros however there is more to the story with some pretty big software and processing improvements for example the iPhone 15 Pros now combine your usual four into one pixel bins 12 megapixel photo with a full fat 48 megapixel photo giving us a more detailed 24 megapixel shot and also despite having double the megapixels the file size of each photo is only about 50 bigger Apple have also introduced three different focal length options for the main camera so you've got the default one times which is 24 millimeters tap once for 28 and tap again for 35 equivalent to a 1 1.2 and 1.5 times optical zoom using some clever cropping of that 48 megapixel sensor this is definitely aimed at more Enthusiast photographers who have a particular focal length in mind although it's a shame these new focal length options don't transfer over to video but I reckon one of the most exciting new features is how even in the regular photo mode if the camera detects a face a cat or a dog or even if you just simply tap on a subject it will now capture a depth map so you can actually turn this regular photo into a portrait where you can then adjust the bokeh level and also the focal point so if you see this little f-stop icon pop up then you know it's capturing the portrait info and you can tap it if you want to preview that bokeh and then if you press edit on the photo there is this new portrait button that turns it into a portrait with that tasty background blur so the idea is you don't have to worry about whether I should take a regular photo or a portrait which previously had higher shutter lag and missed out on Smart HDR because now with these next Generation portraits as Apple calls it portraits now use the same photonic engine pipeline so their fancy background processing as a regular photo so there's no compromise in quality or shutter lag and for me this is one of the most significant camera upgrades this year night mode shots as well as the new portraits also benefit from Apple's fancy photonic engine and deep Fusion processing now and according to Apple we're looking at up to two times better low light quality and the latest smart hdr5 processing should improve dynamic range color and detail across all cameras and modes up front we have the same 12 megapixel true depth selfie camera as before but this also gets next-gen portraits so again your regular selfies can now be turned into portraits after the fact plus we get all the benefits of that new smart hdr5 as for video the main difference now is that you can shoot that prores at 4k60 we have new log and HDR options and the video quality particularly low light should be improved now usually the selfie camera gets forgotten uh in many phones but not so much with the iPhone and also not so much with video and actually this can also shoot a 4k60 also known prores with login HDR yes it's lower megapixel than a rear camera but it has pretty much all the same features as well as small HDR and the next gen portraits for photos so all that sounds great but is the camera quality really that much better than last year well let me show you a few side by sides and also make sure you have subscribed as I have a full camera comparison with the Galaxy s23 Ultra in the works but my takeaway is that there isn't a huge amount in it I think the most obvious change is how the 15 Pros lean towards a warmer white balance which I would say is a little bit more accurate some shots are also noticeably less over sharpened some photos on the 14s look like someone's just turned the clarity slider up in Lightroom too far now photos look more natural and actually if we crop in so just literally pinch in on that one time shot you can see there is more detail and that's thanks to the new 48 plus 12 megapixel combined shot although on the face of it you may be hard-pressed and noticed now to answer the question of is the 15 Pro Max's Zoom better than the pros well it comes down to what you want really so between 1 and 2.9 times Zoom they're basically the same between 3 and 4.9 the pro wins but then 5 to 25 times the Promax wins makes sense given the hardware and of course in an Ideal World we'd see the pro Max with four lenses like the s23 ultra so there isn't a compromise but the question is do you prefer a three times portrait or a five times portrait 84 millimeters or 120. you can obviously shoot both on both phones although the quality isn't going to be the same and the real world difference with the pro Max is that you just have to take two or three steps back what you can now do as my cameraman James is demonstrating is Jump between all the different lenses while shooting at 4K 60. previously you couldn't go to ultra Wide Auto photo depending on which one you started with but now at the highest resolution and frame rate you can switch between them all and I'm kind of curious how it looks going between those lenses just darting in and out obviously I can't see but hopefully you'll let me know in the comments what do you think how's that five times stability although I had hoped they'd have made some changes and upgrades to the Cinematic Mode still stuck to 4K 30 no prores or log options it still looks pretty good particularly in nice lighting but there is no kind of new next-gen mode of cinematic where if you shoot regular video you can then add depth stuff afterwards maybe next year I'm also pleased to see that they have slightly reduced the lens flare it's definitely still there and we get those sort of light floaters as I call them but in this particular shot you can no longer see the camera lens outline but what do you think of this new camera system would it tempt you to upgrade another upgrade is actually the price it's now cheaper or at least here in the UK Apple always set their prices by US Dollars first and then look at other currencies and adjust for inflation and tax and things but the iPhone 15 the regular one is actually 50 pounds cheaper now in the UK starting at 799 down from 849 the 15 Pro is 100 quid cheaper it's now starting at 999 rather than 1099 and the 15 Pro Max is actually the same price 11.99 but now with 256 gigs of storage anyway let's wrap up this review should you buy a 15 pro and pro Max well it all depends if you do an upgrade how old is your current phone I reckon anyone with an iPhone 11 or older yes go for it in terms of the Pro versus the pro Max for me it comes down to the bigger battery that's why I want this guy and also I prefer the bigger screen which is actually now a lot more comfortable to use because of the sort of smaller form factor but I reckon even if as a package it's not that significantly different from 14 pro Max the there are lots of nice incremental upgrades and as I say with the pro GPU with USBC this is kind of like the new Baseline for iPhones if you buy anything older without USBC you can restricted to last gen stuff but what do you reckon are you tempted to upgrade have you already ordered one let me know what you make of the new 15 Pros in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you next time right here on the tech chat"

		"captions": "true why are you always so negative now not negative really I've said lots of nice things about Apple all you do is complain I don't want to hear you complain anymore I only want to hear you defend things about Apple I only want to hear you say good things about Apple well I've been highlighting all of the great features of Mac OS Sonoma I've been loving the iPhone 15 I can talk all day about how cool the new Air all I'm hearing is complaining from you when do you ever have anything nice to say do you have anything nice to say or are you just gonna keep complaining it's not my job to say nice things it's your job to say nice things my job is to complain I'm actually gonna say all of the really great things about the iPhone 15 now so this is a positive video I'm sick of you I'm done wow didn't even know there were stairs there let's begin for the first time in many years it genuinely feels like the entry-level iPhone is honestly really good it's like actually worth recommending to so many people out there and the other bigger thing I love about the iPhone 15 frankly this is not going to be a video with too many negatives there's not going to be too many drawbacks with this one because honestly it just feels like apple listened to so many of my criticisms throughout the years yes I know I've been fairly critical on Apple but I think that's all just to make the product better which when Apple listens it genuinely does get substantially better if you scroll back and watch through my old review videos you'll notice I say things like I want the frosted glass to come down to the entry level iPhones check we got that and with the squared off edge design from the beginning in 2020 when they first brought that back I was the one saying yeah this is cool looking but it's not as comfortable so Apple rounds off the edges and makes this iPhone so much more comfortable to hold it also made it lighter than the last couple generations of entry level iPhone which is great notice visibly lighter than my iPhone 11 and I won't go as far as to say it's as comfortable as the rounded off iPhones were but I can't complain too much when they've combined something I've been asking for for years frosted glass with the aluminum rails oh it is just it is just elegant it is beautiful I love this design it doesn't pick up a bunch of crappy fingerprints like the titanium or steel iPhones do aluminum can handle the internal heat of iPhone so much better than those other materials do it's recyclable it's just an overall great material in my opinion for phones I think all iPhones should be made of aluminum personally and then on top of that they brought one of the coolest features from the 14 pro the dynamic Island now down to the cheaper iPhone which has been a terrific reminder honestly on how cool and how much attention to detail Apple puts in that little island like getting different waveforms dependent on the album art that you're playing even with YouTube music instead of Apple music the timers that you can throw up there the airdrop status indicators are so much cooler than what you can get on notched iPhones so on top of all of these things I've been asking for of course the big one the big enchilada that I've been demanding for years we also get USBC which was not quite as fully unlocked as a lot of us were hoping you know we expected some faster charging and you know a lot of us were disappointed by USB 2.0 speeds but I gotta admit I can understand the vast majority of people out there are not transferring data through this port and you know this is an entry level iPhone so not that many people would have noticed the faster speeds even if it was implemented there but the main thing that I really wanted USBC for and I think most of us did was having one charger for everything so finally after all these years I've actually been able to use one USBC cable to charge my MacBook and my iPhone super handy super convenient and on top of that this supports a lot of USBC accessories like I've done videos now where I plug in my zoom microphone thanks to its USB audio output directly into my iPhone and the iPhone registers that external mic and you can even plug in USBC adapters and dongles which we all have from the 2016 MacBook days and that let me power the iPhone while it's also using the external microphone and even do continuity camera with that external microphone so I basically was able to convert my zoom H6 microphone into a wireless mic from my MacBook simply through the USBC Port this could not have been done with lightning trust me I've tried and on top of that now my iPhone can charge other devices Apple didn't talk much about being able to charge other smartphones but you technically can it's just kind of slow at four and a half Watts but if you wanted to charge your Apple watch or airpods on the go for whatever reason this does technically output enough power to do that battery life is the same as before but in my opinion that's still great and on top of all of the listening Apple has been doing throughout the years they also implemented my top requested feature for iOS 17 and iOS 16 and iOS 15 which is a charge limiter I know not all of you guys are interested in this but for those of us us who work at a desk or have wireless chargers in the car and are basically always charging the phone simply because there's usually a charger wherever we are having a charge limiter helps preserve the battery life a lot more and makes me feel less guilty about the phone being capped at 100 and also lets you override that stupid optimized battery charging algorithm which never gets my charging routines right I'm very confused though as to why this is just an iPhone 15 feature charge limiters are great as an option you don't have to use it it's off by default but I think everybody should get that and hopefully Apple adds that to older iPhones soon it's a very simple basic line of code honestly so it's great and I love the fact that it's on the iPhone 15 but seriously it Apple come on like bring that to the iPhone 11 so I'm just overall impressed with how many requests I've had over the years that Apple has now implemented in this generation which is why I'm gonna try my best to keep being critical and keep suggesting things a higher power output for charging devices at a faster rate would be nice of course you know I don't think it would hurt anybody to get some USB 3.0 speeds on this charge port as well not that I would honestly utilize them that much even when I recorded my tech and Ev videos straight off of the iPhone 15 I was able to airdrop like 13 minute 4K at 60 videos to my MacBook within four minutes and you know I know airdrop's not the fastest thing but still that's pretty freaking cool that wirelessly without having to plug anything into my Mac I can send that high resolution of a video that's that long and have an external microphone supported with it along the way so yeah seriously I struggled to find criticisms with this phone I guess I should address the most obvious one that everyone complains about with the entry level iPhones yeah so this display is still 60 hertz and I guess people in the Android Community are very upset by this because the vast majority of Android phones even in the 500 price range are rocking 120 hertz but usually they're not rocking ltpo which is what I think apple is truly waiting for you know obviously just capping the refresh rate at 100 120 is going to be much much worse for the battery life it also tends to make the OLED panels wear out faster so personally I totally understand why apple is still keeping promotion as a pro feature I've tried to show so many people in my life 120 hertz and 60 hertz and very very few people are actually able to detect the difference and I don't care even if you say that well they feel the difference or you won't notice it but like you should still have it anyway and I mean first of all let's not get into the can of worms that is the supply chains which are already struggling to keep up with demand for the 15 Pros so yeah apple doesn't have the production capacity or the suppliers in place because iPhones sell at much higher volumes than individual Android phones out there they don't have the supplies basically to bring ltpo to every single iPhone otherwise the wait times on all these things would be way way longer and every year apple is buying up as many displays as possible as they can from Samsung LG and Boe and they still usually can't keep up with demand that's the main thing preventing 15 pros from being mass produced at higher volume well there you go I guess we already opened that can of worms but personally having gotten used to 60 hertz on all of the older iPhones I've been reviewing this year it's fine the a16 chip in this thing is still super Snappy super responsive honestly feels much snappier and more responsive than my liquid Retina display on the iPhone 11. even though they're both technically 60 hertz like for the vast majority of people out there this is fine it saves the battery life it extends the longevity of the display which also is just as bright now as both the 14 pros and the 15 Pros in my opinion definitely takes away a lot of the incentives or reasons to get a 15 Pro in the first place particularly thanks to the massive camera upgrades we got this year so I'm no Pro photographer videographer or anything as I'm sure you guys can tell but it's safe to say apple is definitely not doing much with the ultra wide lens that's pretty much been unchanged since the iPhone 11. it's still a 12 megapixel sensor that looks fine but it's just inherently softer and more noisy than the main sensor which is the real star of the show this is the first year they're bringing the 48 megapixel camera down to the entry level iPhone and man I have to admit this sensor continues to impress me not only does smart hdr5 or whatever generation we're on result in substantially better video quality in pictures and side by side yeah it's it's harder to tell I've done a lot of side by side comparisons with my iPhone 11 which is now over four years old and compared it to the iPhone 15 and in my opinion it's negligible for the vast majority of like outdoor normal photo shoots it's not going to be super noticeable but if you're recording videos that's where I think the dynamic range really starts to show I know I'm not talking about Apple's you know Dolby Vision HDR crap you turn that off right away because anytime you try to put that footage in Final Cut it breaks it and gets confused even though your MacBook has an xdr display or whatever yeah don't get me started on HDR but once you turn off HDR this thing produces amazing videos so well in fact that it makes me not realize I need a telephoto lens anymore there's so many downsides I've realized over the years with having a dedicated telephoto lens because typically when you're cropped in more your aperture can't be as good and the sensor size isn't as big which oftentimes even iPhones with their perfect little you know equal lens distance they're not equal distance you're still able to tell exactly when you're pinching to zoom in a video and the lens switches to another sensor you know it gets noisier it gets more pixelated and it gets a little darker and apple tries their best to calibrate all the lenses but you can still tell when the perspective shifts a little bit whereas with this thing no 48 megapixels gives you tons of detail to work with so that even if you're recording a video and you're pinching to zoom you're still retaining that 4K resolution quality because you're just focusing in on more of those pixels out of the whole sensor so I was able to record a Taylor Swift EV video that I needed to zoom in on a little bit but I didn't lose any quality even though it was purely technically a digital Zoom I mean Apple calls it Optical which I don't really agree with either but there's got to be a middle ground here because usually when someone refers to a digital Zoom everyone just assumes you mean cropping like oh yeah you're just crapping in on the video that's not actually zooming but this is not that it's it's literally more of the zoom and enhanced functionality that actually is able to retain that resolution as you're zooming in but still technically yes it's not an optical lens it's not like the physical Hardware is actually doing anything to zoom in but it's still retaining a ton of resolution and a ton of quality so I have to give some credit to the fact that you're able to zoom in you don't get that perspective change you don't get that awkward clunk okay we're on the telephoto lens now and frankly with the 48 megapixel sensor you can zoom in up to 10x now without a telephoto lens and the quality is still like pretty good in fact I'm not feeling like I'm missing out on anything with a 15 Pro because the sensor is so big on this thing and a lot of people ended up preferring the video quality of my videos shot on this entry level iPhone 15 compared to the black magic pocket cinema camera that I normally use to record my videos so honestly extremely impressive camera system for daytime photos not that different you know the front facing camera basically hasn't changed since the iPhone 11 either there's slight enhancements with HDR but with low light shots I had a lot of people telling me on Twitter that they actually preferred the color science of the iPhone 11. the sharpness was definitely better on the iPhone 15 but a lot of people didn't like the way the colors felt more washed out so if you're looking for a reason to keep your older iPhone if you care what Twitter thinks a lot of people were saying the iPhone 11 gets colors better while the 15 gets detailed better but I think that's all semantics personally like you can mess around with the colors and you got photographic Styles you can switch between if you want more saturation or more contrast I never really got those side by side comparisons that much anyway because there's so much editing you can do after the fact that will make so much more of a noticeable difference than what you can tell between iPhone generations and I know another question that came up a lot was people worried about heat and I'm happy to say that my iPhone 115 has not had any overheating issues nothing that got it to the point of shutting down you know if I record a 15 minute 4K at 60 video yes the phone gets hot but it never was like so hot to the touch that oh my God it's unbearable and whenever I plugged in my MacBook charger to this thing obviously it's fast charging at 20 watts it would get pretty hot noticeably but again nothing that would make the phone shut down or say the phone's not gonna charge until it cools off so I didn't have any huge issues but also due to some complications with esim and mint mobile I actually didn't activate my esim in this iPhone as much as I wanted to they were making it complicated to activate and I knew that I didn't want to get rid of my physical Sim in the iPhone 11. so I basically just was rocking two phones for the past week my iPhone 11 still had my sim and then my iPhone 15 would be hot spotted to that so there's a chance that maybe I wasn't experiencing the same overheating as other people because my 5G modems were not technically active in this thing so you're gonna have to leave that perspective to other reviewers out there but overall I genuinely think like this is the star of the show when it comes to the new iPhone 15 lineup the pros seem to be having more issues every day with overheating and the titanium being fingerprint magnets and prone to scratching the cameras on the 15 Pros are not that different or that much better from the 14 pros and sure you got a faster USBC port on the 15 Pro as well but I don't think that many people are genuinely going to be transferring a ton of data through the charge port anyway you know it's not quite Thunderbolt so it wasn't as huge of a deal as I was expecting it to be but they're more expensive and the regular iPhones are just getting so dang good so like at this point in my opinion the best reason to go with the 15 Pro is like you either really really want that action button because everybody's showing you some Siri shortcut that is amazing or you want a dedicated telephoto lens which is going to look slightly better than just the digital Zoom or the zoom and enhanced functionality of the amazing sensor on the regular 15. I guess they get slightly better battery life but the fact that this model that I picked up still come comes with 128 gigs of storage now has six gigs of RAM by default and you can get it for like 800 bucks like yeah this in my opinion got some of the more substantial noticeable upgrades out of the whole lineup and it doesn't have to cost you all that much you don't have to drop a grand on a new iPhone in my opinion to still get a substantial update overall seriously massive compared to the iPhone 14 last year and I know a lot of you are asking well Drew if you love it so much and you're so glad that Apple's listening to you now are you gonna keep this thing and if you've been watching me for a while you already know the answer which is that as much as I love this phone the truth is there's really genuinely nothing wrong with my iPhone 11 and the narrative that I've been trying to promote on this channel is that you shouldn't upgrade based on how good the new phone is you should upgrade based on how bad your current phone is and my iPhone 11 still whenever I put this phone down and pick the old one up I still feel right at home it still feels comfortable in my hand and especially in doing all of those cameras side by sides I'm like you know what yes there's advantages and improvements here but are they the types of videos and picture that I'm taking all that frequently no not really and am I ready to like ditch my pocket Cinema Black Magic Camera for an iPhone to record all of my tech and Ev videos yeah maybe not quite because a lot of people can still tell the difference and I personally think the Blackmagic looks more cinematic and more professional and everybody can kind of tell whenever you start switching to an iPhone camera What I will admit is this as a little bit of a compromise in the middle whenever I do decide to upgrade my iPhone again I don't know when that's going to be it's going to be dependent on how poorly my iPhone 11 ages or how cheap you can find these second hand and refurbished which I think more people should be considering I do think I will get a model pretty much exactly like this you know the black color definitely looks a lot cooler but something that annoys me about my black iPhone 11 is that in dark rooms or dark environments it becomes near impossible to tell if you're holding the front of the phone up or the back of the phone and also for thermal limitations I want to get more lighter toned iPhones if they had a white one or a silver one I would buy diets and they technically do they just for some reason call it blue you know they could have probably easily called this a white iPhone and people would just say oh it has a slightly cooler color temperature to it but I don't think it's necessarily the most Financial responsible thing to do to buy a brand new iPhone on launch day because that's when it's gonna be the most expensive and now that there's ways in settings to check the cycle count as well as the battery health I'm more interested in the second hand market and also as we're trying to be more budget focused on this channel reviewing the latest and not greatest I'm kind of curious to hear what's around the corner for the iPhone SE because there's rumors starting about it right now and we know there's some European Union requirements Apple has to abide by for the end of next year so I think there might be some cheaper USBC iPhones in the future that maybe don't have as great a camera or as bright a display or a dynamic Island but I've proven to myself this year that I don't need like the best of the best iPhone out there I was comfortable and content with my iPhone 10 and se2 and now the iPhone 11 so I'd be willing to wait and see what's on the horizon what's rumored for next year as long as my iPhone 11 is still getting the job done which thankfully it is I'm impressed with how great a camera a four-year-old iPhone is rocking these days and I want to see what the used Market is like for this and also what's rumored to come out with the iPhone 16 series as well as the SE fourth generation is it still gonna have a home button is it going to have one camera you know what are they gonna start it at so many questions that I'm excited to talk more about on this channel with but if you've got the money and you're ready for an upgrade you want a substantially better camera way better design way more comfortable brighter display better charge port that's more Universal for the Modern Age of USBC yeah this thing is freaking awesome and I honestly cannot think of that many bad things to say about it so I'm not quite ready for the upgrade but maybe you guys are feel free to let me know down in the comments which iPhone you think will be your next and what you're waiting for in terms of pricing in the Apple refurbished page or on eBay or Amazon renewed all that good stuff and thank you once again to everybody supporting this channel directly seriously helps us out a ton as does just watching these videos so thanks again this is your apple shape here and I will see you all in the next one [Music]"

		"captions": "Derek Lima Leon Do you have any opinion about the new iPhone 15 and Apple's difficulty in innovating Apple announced the iPhone 15 people are a little disappointed because they wanted more what Apple is selling is not something useful for 90% of users  I think in terms of what it's adding compared to the iPhone 14 Okay, but I think I have the solution, there's a new app that was announced yesterday, it's from another company, it's not Apple, which for me saves the iPhone, saves the iPhone, but  one way is the way is more exactly a big change in the iPhone the iPhone will now have USBC the iPhone will have USBC which is this connection here and we have had it since the S8 and the S7 I think it was the last one with micro USB Apple will  put usbc on the iPhone in the old days Apple Live in rotten which is its proprietary port which was a very bad deal people keep asking when to switch to SBC when Apple introduced Lightning it was in fact better than the micro USB that we had  but the SBC is far superior in many ways and not only does it allow compatibility with a huge range of accessories and devices, you have just one cable to charge everything, right, your laptop, your cell phone, your headphones, everything with SBC  Why didn't they adopt SBC before? Simple answer because the market for cable lines and Light devices for licensing these devices to Apple was multimillion-dollar, what they sold for cables wasn't in the book and they charged a lot, of course, of course, you there in the Brazil probably had no problem buying the Light cable in Pirat\u00e3o from the street vendor to connect it to your cell phone because you didn't want to pay the price that the Apple store charged, which in fact How much is it? Wow, this one, I'll get to it later, okay, it's for you  have an idea of cable prices, this is a cable, okay guys, this is a cable, but I'm going to get the Lightning, a standard Lightning to USBC cable, 219, I count in Brazil, oh my God, I'm going to tell you, given this price, you would go and you would have no problem buying the one.  street vendor to buy or unauthorized, but in North America in Europe where people earn in dollars in euros, it's not really, people simply went to the Apple store and bought, not only that, there is a whole licensing business also for accessories and such, I don't know how to say it properly because I'm not from that side, but Apple made a lot of money. There was a huge incentive at the time to keep this Line cable, but the European Union approved a regulation that smartphones had to have a USB cable, a USB connection, because  to reduce the amount of waste, right, you use a cable for several devices Exactly everything and And then they were forced to change and the fact that they used lighting for me was a bit of an absurd thing because they started to add the function for you to record in Progress which  It's a much better video format for professional editing and such on the iPhone, but when you get your files from the iPhone because it creates a very large file, right, your video files to transfer to the PC took 1 zillion hours  because the light Mini on the iPhone worked with USB 2.0, what is USB 2.0, you ask me this one, more or less the usbc standards that we have, no, they are not all because there is no usb4 here and also these names here have already changed several times  Sometimes the people who decide on the name of the USB, like the organization, right? They're really bad at it, they've already changed the name several times, USB 2.0 has already been called 3.0, it's been called 3.1 3.2 3.2 at last, but they worked at this speed here, at 400 MB per  second 400 MB 480 MB per second is basically 60 megabytes per second it's slow as hell and that's what the iPhone had until now if you tried to remove any file from your iPhone because they want to encourage you to use other technologies including iCloud which is the  their subscription service for cloud storage so this was very complicated now they introduced this USB here with usbc which is this one they call G2 which in fact or 10 GB is much faster several times faster than the other one  There's a problem, although SBC is adopted, it's safe, this speed here is 10 GB, 10 gabits per second, it's only on the pro and promex, the normal iPhone 15, despite having the SBC, still works on USB 2.0. You'll still have this  speed right here with the new connection and if I'm not mistaken, but that's not the case, it's not just an Apple thing, it's on pro smartphones, despite having access to this speed, the cable that comes with it is still USB 2.0, you 'll have to  buy a 10 Gabi per second USB cable to be able to have the speed that the smartphone supports But this is not just an Apple thing, other Smartphone companies do this, this is also normal for the cable that comes in the box to be USB 2.0 despite the smartphone having support for 3.0 but we have to remember that Apple charges this here is Thunderbolt, okay I don't know if this here is Thunderbolt this here is for the Mac, right in the SBC 1800 what is this here it is Thunderbolt for Mike  like, it's absurd, it's absurd, this charge, for the love of God, is not exactly the one you'll need, okay, this one is a much faster car, this one is equivalent to what is usb4, right, for Mac, but it's very expensive and Apple  Cobra Expensive on these cables, this here people will buy in time like this the guy goes there to buy the iPhone then I need a cable to have this faster speed he was already buying at the Apple store he will buy from Apple they will earn a lot  money anyway this is about SBT but there's more that's interesting now is that they have the first three nanometer processor in a smartphone This one, I'm not mistaken, the first three nanometer processor which is the size of its lithography with is basically a somewhat abstract indication  but that indicates how small you can make a transistor in it, so as far as we know, the iPhone's processor will be with the smallest transius in the world, I don't know, you can say it that way, but it will be the first mass-made processors with  this new technology which is a technology from a company called tsmc because Apple develops processors but it is an example of other companies it also does not manufacture. It depends on another company manufacturing for it and tsmc is the main one in the world that makes processors for  a lot of people see AMD things like that but Apple made an agreement they must be paying a lot more to have exclusivity for time in this new technology in this three nanometer lithography but the processors in this lithograph are only those of the iPhone pro and pro  Max of the iPhone 15 without being pro and pro Max you will basically have last year's processor which is a trend that Apple started last year, if I'm not mistaken, always giving last year's processor to iPhones that are not pro  So you won't have the three dwarves, you won't have this benefit of performance gains and such, this deficiency of this new technology, they also said that this new technology will have support for Tracy hardware, here you have a scene without Ray tracing And then they go  Turn on Ray tracing and now Ray tracing understands, you see before you didn't have them. Look at the reflection of these lights from above that appear in place, this kind of orange reflection, something like that, they start to appear in various places, understand, because basically you're calculating in time  real the dynamic reflection of these lights here, obviously it's not all raytracing because these painted lights here are still there, right, but at least these lights here you're seeing their reflections everywhere, I don't know what the use of this here will be because if I  I'm not mistaken, the Snapdragon 8g2 already has hardware support but I don't know of any game that uses this, probably Apple, as it has a greater dominance in the market with standardization, will encourage someone to use it in games But I personally haven't seen it yet It's gone to have on Android I don't know of any game that actually has it and it also has the titanium thing with this guy but I want to talk about the worst thing I saw which is the camera thing because you didn't like it because they announced that now the  promax will have a periscopic camera in the style that we saw a while ago, already on Android other brands If I'm not mistaken, xiaomi has one of these ruins and has one of these nine 2020 is from the s20 which is a periscopic camera that allows a  currently on the iPhone, their telephoto camera has a three-fold zoom, but now with this periscopic camera, which is a prism that bends the light so you can place the sensor further away from the lens, which allows you to zoom further, right?  you will have a 5x zoom but that's the problem it will only come on the iPhone 15 pro Max the iPhone 15 pro doesn't have the iPhone 15 pro it still has the 3x zoom but there is a problem if you get the iPhone 15 pro Max with a 5x zoom you seriously lose the three. So it's actually a choice because if you get the promex which has the 5x zoom if you want to zoom in three what it will do is take the main camera lens and  give it a crop So in fact you will have a better 5x zoom but your 3x zoom will be worse what happened Samsung did this I think Samsung did it right when they put the I don't know how many X thing on the s20, right?  the s20 was 10 then in the note 20 it was five it kept the 3x lens So you have the perscopic lens here then you have the 3x they didn't have one here then you have the main and you have the wide angle so I thought it was kinda  complicated because it's not a necessary upgrade it's a trade but the problem is that they linked it to the size of the smartphone if you want a pro with the big screen you only have the 5x you don't have the option of the three and one thing they tried to sell  now that I found it interesting but I didn't see such a huge impact on their presentation They added this function Now that the iPhone will record in Progress like 14 it already does but it will also record to an external SSD in log I'm going to show the video here  for you to take a look, it was very interesting, the video will also be a little curious because I think this was my failure in their marketing, although Apple is very good at marketing, Apple is like, you have something that does n't work  in all other companies, it's an art Because they know how to communicate very well what their devices do, it's a problem that I think is one of the limitations that I see in Samsung's communication is that Samsung does a lot of things but Most of the people don't know, I already came to us who were users of the Galaxy S. Years ago I said, did you know that there is a Dex mode that you can connect it to the computer and use it as if it were a desktop, people have never heard of it, oh Apples  all the little things that Apple does, you know, I remember when they introduced proless, which is this video codec, right, it's very good, that professionals use it, you have it on the iPhone, I'm also saying that the iPhone does exactly professionals, but it is.  one more I saw people who didn't even know what they were going to use this for saying did you know that there is I say it like this you make professional videos no but there is the person knew because Apple knows how to communicate well but here what I want to comment on is this thing  what they did here, for cinema, right? They want to show this cinema function, it was very good. The video even made a cinema scene, but the guy is filming with the iPhone, then the production person runs away with HD, she took the HD from the iPhone.  and someone is already saying something like that, that 's not what you want to see, you want to pay attention to the background and they're going to do it from here, here the person goes and records it on an external HD, right in 4K You can record up to six k and things like that up to 60, sorry, 60 frames at 4K And then they show a whole movie scene and such and then the person takes the HD, takes it out of the camera, takes the HD that is stuck there, the camera is stuck in a stabilizer, hands it over there and the guy starts it up and  Now open it in da Vinci, solve it then for some reason the guy will start doing color correction when the last thing you 're going to do is review, yes, editing, maybe to cut something he did, it's obvious, it's not to show that you record on vlog  Okay guys, my criticism here is that they took it and now you can make a cinema in your house, so and so. Because this film is like a cinema, I only need 100 million dollars to hire this team. It's not really like that in the sense of ha ha, what  I think it looks strange in terms of communication because if it showed, for example, someone doing a journalistic article, right? That would be the most useful thing. Ah, maybe even a YouTube video, something plus an Indian short, something like that, I think it would make more sense, but then they get it.  something that we do Where's the key, you understand that we do crazy business with a little camera, I understand what they tried to do, right?  The cost of the camera here is the last concern you have, right? It's true, but it's interesting. I understand why they did that. The person coming here is filming.  That's it, people saw, like, very few people have an application for this, I do, and I would be interested, but I saw that there was a lack of communication there to talk about the value of this, too, I think, but it's increasingly difficult for everyone who makes a smartphone.  It's not just for Apple to justify the new format the new device because apart from the foldable ones that are still in place, it's still a market that still has a lot of room for innovation because the slab smartphone format is consolidating, right ?  We already have the final format of the thing, all the Improvements we make, they are like peripherals, right, they are too small, it is difficult to justify something new and not only that, Apple has this problem, which in the iPhone's main selling points is performance  So now they want to put triple-A games on the iPhone. They're going to put Resident Evil and stuff like that, who's going to pay like 50 dollars for Resident Evil to just play on a screen this small, right? The great thing about the Switch is that you can connect it to your  television too, right? I think it's complicated because now the level of performance that smartphones have is already enough for 99% of people, 99% of people would come with and live with the performance of a processor from, I don't know, four years ago, right? There was a time when  every time your new Smartphone is used to consume social media for professionals, yes you would need it but There was a time when you justified buying a smartphone every year based on performance because you had a transition the first smartphones used a setup box processor that connects to the television the first  iPhone used a Samsung box, it even connects to the television to have other channels and things like that, it's a streaming service and so on, so the performance you had for several years wasn't enough using a smartphone, it was a commitment, it was just clicking and waiting, right now?  No, now a smartphone, that's how you can buy a Smartphone cheaper and that's enough, but there's one thing I have to say, which is the following, at least for a person like me, a company did something really innovative, it's the following yesterday, black Magic, which is a company that makes da Vinci, solves this application here where they show the editing of the video here, including this table here, they also sell this application This color editing application is from Black, which is a company that makes  a lot of camera things they launched a new camera including also 6k full frame they make cameras very cheap Type 6 offers 2500 for very cheap for a camera they do studio things too and they make several cameras including several things that you watch broadcast  on the internet things like it's done with their equipment and they also make the da Vinci Resort which is the editor that I use that has that color correction thing and so on.  but what they announced is this, just try to enter iPhone, give me this on Android, please. We call it you being in the background of gaga, right, something like that, it's a black Magic that we use to film that, this app here is an app that gives you all the manual camera control functions on your smartphone, and you can  Doing a lot of things has the entire digital interface and you can even talk to the people who are producing things with you. It's a trip. But there is one, but they have a service called black Magic Cloud, which is their cloud service. Look here  What can you do with a Smartphone? Smartphone and it will show what you are filming with the clouds automatically, not just with the clouds it will sit with a project within the video editor so I can be filming something here I have someone working on editing somewhere else in the world  I just filmed it, now feel everything with the clouds and it appears within the video editing project for the person on their computer, I 'll show you how it works, let me see here, this one is the da Vinci visual, they make this application and it  There's a whole suite here that you can use, you have it here, for example, this is the editing part, right? So all the things I edit, so on, you come here now and there's this is the special effects part. here also for coloring you can do color correction here you will have some here there are some little color corrections that I made there is one that I spend a lot of time I am learning trying to improve the audio quality of my videos So you have it here  all the videos to correct the audio too And in the end you come here and render it and what they are doing is that you film with this application you will pay there is a monthly subscription which you are not mistaken is 15 dollars for 500 GB that's it  good as hell, as soon as you stop at the stop you can send it, yes, man, you can simulate the original file or make a proxy, which is a smaller version of the file you recorded and the editor starts working on it, it appears within his project.  It's moving here in the Puff edition The image has arrived, edit things and such, you can send a chat to communicate with it and say what you want within the application itself and it's only available for the iPhone. I'm going to talk about how this is innovative because, for example, imagine that  you are a video a video journalist video reporter you are on the street you can now that you have USB if on the iPhone connect your receiver via usbc be it DJ's something like that on the Smartphone you can control the audio level on it you can also put your  reporter, right, speaking to the camera, you film it with all these manual controls, as soon as you finish it, you send the file, so you can have an editor in the newsroom just to receive your file, start editing, there is no longer this scheme of you having to go back to writing to deliver to the editor You could only start editing after you got there and it has all the professional formats it records in Progress up to 444 it records in h264 and h265 for the guys you have to upload something quickly, right, that's impressive and it's all combined because this  company, they control an application and they also control the video editor and the service and the server in the clouds so it's all together, everything talks and the most impressive thing is that it's all apart from his cloud subscription which is per month at 15 dollars for 500  GB it's all a membership fee you buy the editor and that's it you buy the editor if I get 300 it's not a subscription you pay once you have it forever and the Smartphone app is free No it's not free in the free version it's free that's it I want Doubtless, if this were if this were a presentation, if you were at Apple's presentation, destroy it because, like, what do people today, your biggest problem, especially people who work with video, right? It's like, coordinating things with whoever is  on the street, so backup is so easy and it's already within the project, not only that, if you want to mix images from a professional camera, there will be a camera that will be compatible with this service, you will be able to send it directly from the camera, there is only one that is  a Black doctor for now, but this way, if you have something filming a professional camera, you can then go to the computer and upload the file from your camera to the ubers and the person, the editor, will have the files from the smartphone and the camera on the other side, it will speed up  Otherwise, the process you can just upload the proxy which is a smaller version of your file to upload faster if you have data limitations for the editor to start working and then you go to where the editor is, hand over the smartphone and it will download the files integers and just replace them in the program with the original file and it will have everything in the complete step resolution that this burns, for example thinking about the journalism production system for example and the amount of opening up possibilities for Independent media to act because you eliminate  at a cost of investment in equipment that was inhibiting, you understand initiatives and now it's kind of democratized a lot, it expands a lot, it's impressive, even if you have it, you get the smartphone, in this case, it only has it for the iPhone, so far it has one day for Android. Honestly, don't worry.  They said it's exclusive, right? No, they launched first. Now, they do n't have any exclusivity with Apple, including the Android editor. where I know It runs better on the Mac It's because it's easier for them to adapt because the amount of hardware on the Mac It's smaller, right, it's not like Windows, which has every combination of processor and video card possible that you can imagine, it's impressive because you  buy a little lace like the one the guy had in the video pro o pro pro in this case it will have to be the iPhone there is no way you guarantee stability guarantee stability you buy an ND filter which is for as there is no lock there is no diaphragm in law you  You have to control the light in some way to make it better, it's not necessary but the quality is better so you can use the right shutter speed, you connect via USB a microphone, the receiver puts the transmitter either on the microphone or not on the lapel, I'm not going to the reporter to talk  In this case, if it was someone doing journalism or you yourself, you can hold the camera here in the vlog, right, and place where it appeals to you here. I'll record whatever you want at the moment you clicked Stop. I think you can even program it to be automatic. Send it now.  It's going up, you're going to do the next subject and the best part is to provide security too because no one will be able to take your card, right? memory he has to fight for the tape and someone pulls the tape on one side and pulls the tape on the other, so this happens when someone relaxes and just nods, it was with the police or with other actors. The police are logically clear, so you put about 5g  even more so for the people who do it for television you only need to do full HD only when full HD h265 When you were arrested there in Greece if that had happened you couldn't have deleted it I deleted the file here it had already been uploaded understand I even have it to this day the file is because you don't know I was detained I wasn't almost arrested I was in fact detained I was detained for a while they decide whether to prosecute me or not because I filmed a military base in Greece without knowing then when I was leaving the base I took my cell phone  and I just recorded my reaction at the time at the stage for the company but I was so upset that I went later and deleted it and I told him to let him, he will have to do the simulation again but anyway, if I had this system I wouldn't lose material, you know, it would be  oh, heaven, the next trip we take, we have to have a system like this working on our cell phones, this is sensational, this one that black Magic did, it's a company like this, that's why I've never regretted having made the conversion, okay guys, I came from  from Adobe Premier I made the transition to Da Vinci da Black Adobe Premier is Adobe basically controls the market for this market of internet production, things like that, even TV, they have like, I don't know, 80, 90% of the market, but then I decided  switching to this other editor mainly because it's not a subscription, right, I pay once and it's always there and then it's cheaper and it's not because Adobe charges it doesn't seem more expensive for the company here so I could put it as a company expense I had to subscribe  as a company I paid, like, a lot more than an individual person, it doesn't make any sense because it's the same application, but then I made this transition and I actually think it's worth it because now we 're getting almost all of my  the whole system talking to each other because this company not only makes software but also makes hardware, I also have his desk for things like changing the camera and so on, so it was really worth it now with this I'm just going to wait for it to arrive on Android because honestly  I can't give up the Ultra at all because after I did the track in Greece and the 10x camera saved my life a lot of times, not even the professional camera I was carrying in my hand had a zoom to reach I can't give up and I really want this on Android, it's going to be wonderful"

		"captions": "so it's official after many rumors leaks and town right impatience the iPhone 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max are officially here and man out the gate orders came flying in for these phones not too long after pre-ordering was made available shipping dates started getting pushed up by months and man there were lines at Apple Stores across the Globe last Friday with hundreds of people hoping they could get their hands on one of these popular devices to avoid long shipping delays and I'm happy to say that I was lucky enough to get my hands at both the iPhone 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max on the first day it was made available and I've been using both for about a week now and I gotta say it's been an interesting experience so far Apple made some really unique choices this year for their beloved smartphone and a part of me could understand the initial draw for many people looking to upgrade this year but honestly there's another side of me that feels as though these phones are a bit underwhelming and let's start with the first real major change that the iPhone 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max bring to the table and that's its build material taking a page out of the Apple watch ultra's Playbook Apple decided to forego the use of stainless steel the premium material is using on its Pro iPhone for quite some time now and use titanium instead generally speaking titanium is a significantly stronger metal in comparison to aluminum and even stainless steel which in theory should help mitigate damage to the iPhone's frame now I will say it doesn't make the glass flanking the funner back of the phone any stronger so keep that in mind it's still using Apple's ceramic Shield which is pretty strong for glass but you're still going to want to make sure you do everything in your power not to drop by the phone on the concrete early stress tests are not looking good for this phone but the use of titanium is a welcome change here it has a much nicer brushed finish as opposed to the reflective polished one they've used before and they're nicely color matched to the new iPhone colorways I've got the 15 Pro Max and the new blue titanium that looks incredibly Sleek very beautiful in person and I've got the 15 Pro Max in this new natural titanium color and has this industrial look to it as the phone is supposed to resemble basically a slab of metal I think the titanium looks the best in this particular colorway it's less fingerprint and smudge prone and overall it's one of the most unique looking iPhones to date and to me it's not necessarily the strength titanium that makes it appealing but rather the added benefit of making this phone significantly lighter titanium is fantastic because it offers exceptional toughness and protection without making your device feel like a tank this is a big deal for me as a pro Max user since the iPhone 13 Pro Max I've always felt as though the pro Max variants were too heavy to the point where holding them for extended periods of time would start to get fatiguing and uncomfortable so the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max being much lighter is a big plus here another part of the older design that contributed to the discomfort was the way that the stainless steel frame integrated into the glass it was completely squared off at a 90 degree angle so not only did it make the big phone harder to grip it kind of felt like the frame was almost digging into your palm so in an effort to make the 15 Pro lineup more comfortable Apple ever so slightly rounded off the frame so it's easier to hold it's very hard to notice just by looking at it but it is a better feeling in the hand overall but aside from the new build material and the new colors there's really not much else that has changed with the 15 Pro when talking form factor and I'm just gonna say it's kind of disappoint pointing I was really hoping for more of an overhaul to this look that the iPhone has had since basically the iPhone 12 and even though there's nothing wrong with it it is starting to get a little old there was so much hype going into this drop as this was supposed to be the year for the makeover and I just feel as though we got more of the same though the minor updates have made the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max enjoyable to use one week later they're undeniably familiar devices that have left me wanting more from a design standpoint now yes the iPhone 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max didn't usher in the facelift we all wanted but it did bring in some much needed changes from a functionality standpoint that I think are really important number one after many years of Apple essentially saying Fu to everyone it finally folded and made the entire iPhone lineup compatible with USB type-c not because they wanted to no they would have forced fetus lightning for eternity if they could it took the European Union to essentially Force Tim Cook into submission now this is great because most modern devices in general use USB type-c now so it should make it a lot simpler to charge your iPhone the Pro Models also come with added functionality with this part as it can support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second this allows you to very quickly transfer stuff off your phone onto say a computer but also the opportunity for more unique things like recording 4K 60 frames per second in HDR prores by connecting the phone to a portable SSD we'll get into the camera features in just a bit but this is a useful feature if you're really into shooting video with a mobile device the other new feature that's the first for the iPhone is again inspired by the Apple watch Ultra and that's the addition of the action button it replaced the silent switch on the iPhone which I'm not realizing has been on every iPhone ever I think and don't worry if you love the silent switch the action button by default is set to silent and unsign on your phone when you press it but you can now have the luxury of mapping that button to a specific action of your choice and apple went all out on this UI for setting this up and provides some really great options for you to choose from like activating the camera starting a voice memo and my personal favorite which is to run a shortcut this option basically allows you to map the app button to virtually any function on the iPhone given that you know how to use shortcuts I have mine set to unlock my Tesla which is great because there are times where my Bluetooth connection doesn't automatically unlock my doors when I'm walking up to the car so being able to press the action button quickly to unlock is so clutch it's like having a traditional key fob baked into my phone but let's talk about performance on the iPhone 15 Pro this is the first iPhone using Apple's new Pro chip as it's powered by the a17 pro and apple did go into specifics about how this new chipset allows users to not only do things like play console level games but also gain maximum efficiency for things like better battery life and has to be expected from a day-to-day perspective both phones have been performing great everything is Silky Smooth when navigating around the OS Pro motion continues to deliver especially on these displays that have a slightly smaller bezel than before though I haven't been able to test any of the console games the mobile games that I usually play that are relatively spec intensive all perform great and was especially enjoyable in the Pro Max with this larger screen now throughout all this I've been very closely monitoring thermals of both bones there's been a lot of chatter of people experiencing overheating issues with the 15 Pro I did feel the phone get pretty warm the very first day I set up my 15 Pro Max which was concerning but after I did the software update to iOS 17.02 it seemed to have resolved the issue and as far as what my battery life has been one week later this was a big Focus area for me because my battery life in the 14 pro Max has just been terrible if I'm being honest I'm happy to say it's noticeably better I know it's only been a week but I almost got through two full days of modern use on a full charge with my 15 Pro Max very much mirroring the impeccable battery performance I have with 13 Pro Max and it's been a breath of fresh air to say the least Mr who's the boss just did His Brilliant battery test of the new 15 lineup and the results showed the 15 Pro Max doing very well now the regular Pro didn't do as good on this test but so far my experience has been pretty solid I got almost a day and a half on a full charge now I know it's early and I'm definitely knocking on wood here but so far the battery life out the gate seems to be way better than when I was getting on the 14 Pros now let's talk about cameras one of the most important areas of performance and it's really interesting we're starting to see some differentiation happen between the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max though they both come with four cameras total three on the back and one in the front the regular pro has a three times optical zoom lens similar to last year while the pro Max has a new five times optical zoom using a new terrapism design Apple also equipped this particular camera with its 3D sensorship technology which gives users some pretty insane stabilization you can also adjust the focal length settings on the main camera now which is a pretty nifty tool if you're a serious photo shooter so a lot of the features associated with the cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro are becoming more and more Pro like for enthusiasts and Beyond which is really interesting and generally speaking the still images coming out of all the pro cameras are fantastic as to be expected they're tack sharp even if you punch in with the help of the larger sensors colors are accurate and natural looking while still giving excellent dynamic range and I gotta say the portrait shots so far looking excellent speaking of portrait shots a new software feature app Apple introduced with the iPhone 15 is the ability to turn any picture of a person or pen into a portrait picture even if you didn't select portrait mode all you have to do is Select portrait here in the camera app and it'll automatically adjust the photo to a portrait mode one you can also edit the focus Point as well which is kind of sick this is really impressive in terms of processing power the camera has to be taking in a crap ton of data when you press the shutter button in order to have this capability and even though I think it's more of a parlor trick than a feature that will actually be used often No Lie it is pretty cool now where Apple really shines is with its video quality it's so far ahead of the competition and I'm happy to say it keeps pulling forward with what the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max can do when it comes to video much like the still image capabilities Apple seems to be making a concerted effort around giving users pro-like features when it comes to video as you can now shoot at up to 4K 60 in prores so long as you have an external SSD attached to the phone as well as the ability to shoot in a log profile now if you're not a camera nerd like me the simplest way to explain what log profile is it's basically a video format that gives you a very flat unsaturated file but loaded with a ton of Digital Data this gives you way more flexibility in the edit when it comes to color grading to create a more specific look without compromising the quality of the video and it's pretty nuts and a smartphone is actually able to do this now that said I'm pretty sure 99 of people will never use this feature because long footage on its own is not flattering at all it requires some sort of editing which is not the simplest thing to do so again very much geared towards pros and enthusiasts but don't let that worry you out the box the regular 4K footage on the 15 Pro looks amazing without question the best video coming out of any smartphone period and to me it's still the biggest Flex for the iPhone in terms of its process and that brings me to My overall thoughts on the iPhone 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max one week later and here's the thing I think this is Apple's best effort to truly make these devices Pro devices but in that regard it kind of caters to that one percent of people that actually identify as a pro the beastly a17 Pro chip and how it's being leveraged here to give users the ability to play advanced games or have really robust computational photography features or the ability to shoot MOG all of these things are amazing but most will go completely unused by the average consumer with the 15 Pro in his or her hand and if you take those new features away you're honestly not left with anything too exciting with this new offering and because of that I'm a bit more inclined to recommend the non-pro iPhone 15s this year for most people now the pro solid phones one week later everything seems to indicate yes but I'm gonna have to do a lot more long-term testing to really pressure test how it's going to perform over time so make sure that you're subscribed to the channel so you don't miss on the longer term reviews and let me know what you guys think about iPhone 15 Pro are you guys fans of these phones or do you think Apple missed the mark this year here's to get your thoughts let me know what you guys are thinking in the comments down below and in case you guys are interested in learning more about my experience with the 14 pro one year later check out these

The iPhone 15 Pro has this different shooting thanks to intelligent software tips while retaining  only three photo lenses the second photo innovation is reserved for the iPhone 15 pro max which is regrettable because it is very useful the third sensor of the iPhone 15 pro max is a periscope lens which corresponds to a 5x zoom in  In fact, they placed prisms inside the lens to deflect the light 4 times before the sensor catches it, which gives a 5x zoom in a lens that remains compact, it is not only very useful for taking photos  from afar but that also makes it a very interesting device for portrait photography the third innovation is perhaps the one I prefer it concerns video the iPhone 15 Pro can film in log a raw colorimetric profile which retains more details in  the highlights and shadows providing more flexibility for colorimetry in editing which makes me finally consider using the iPhone as a secondary camera on the go because I've seen images that I would never have attributed to a smartphone  well it is time to talk about titanium a change of material is not just due to a desire to renew the design of a product it contact on the experience its design and its operation we can doubt the necessity of such  material for a smartphone it will probably not change your life but I think it is relevant titanium is not a marketing choice it is a remarkable metal which has obvious qualities for the design of a smartphone the first is impact resistance titanium is a metal naturally resistant to traction and it is for this reason that it is used in particular in prostheses the second is its resistance to corrosion due to the presence of a layer of protective oxide on its surface which makes it very resistant to sea water chlorine acids and this protective layer is self-healing because it forms naturally upon exposure to oxygen titanium is widely used in  the construction of submarines in the roosters the propulsion systems and components because it is corrosion resistant the third reason is ecological the process of extracting titanium is less energy intensive than aluminum and the comes from more regulated environment in addition to being a highly recyclable material the fourth is simply aesthetic it is an elegant material and whose resistance allows the 15 pro to have thinner edges and the fifth characteristic is its lightness it can  seem counterintuitive for a more solid material but titanium is one of the materials with the best strength to weight ratio in summary titanium is a more expensive material but more durable more practical more ethical more aesthetic and lighter and if Apple says its  titanium that it is of aerospace quality it's not just marketing either it's because that's the case it respects aeronautical and space standards the iPhone 15 Pro is made of grade 5 titanium an alloy  of titanium containing 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium which further considerably improves the strength of the metal grade 5 titanium is used in aircraft and rocket engines because of its lightness and strength for that reason  does not make the iPhone unbreakable because it is still covered in green on the front and back so the main structure is very well protected the components are very well protected which obviously reinforces the durability of the product but the  titanium will not prevent you from having to go to the Apple Store if you drop it from a height Apple knows this very well because in their presentation they only mentioned how resistant titanium was as a material and they revised the architecture  internal to facilitate the repair of the rear window which he still did go from 600 euros to 200 euros so even with titanium put a shell well let's talk about an argument that will please inoxtag the processor the iPhone 15 Pro  is equipped with the 17 pro chip and it deserves its name it is the first three nanometer processor in the world which means that Apple can integrate more transistors in the same space basically it is more powerful it is useful for the photo and video capabilities for data transfer which allows for example to record videos in a professional format directly on an external medium and this is useful for gaming Apple considers the 17 pro as the biggest overhaul of 4 graphics of its history which allows you to play games that you usually play on console on an iPhone like Assassin's Creed or Resident Evil which you can play with a Bluetooth controller and on a large screen thanks to USB-C this obviously never rivals  a playstation but it is not impossible that the iPhone becomes a very interesting console you see it still makes quite a few changes we cannot say that it is trivial and I retained that what I considered to be major but stainless steel has  still right on something wait do you agree in reality I propose I do n't take any risk we might as well keep the iPhone 13 really we might as well keep the iPhone 13 but in fact it is it is not broken it is good  but there's nothing new that means you might as well keep your iPhone which he's right there's nothing revolutionary on the iPhone 15 and even on the 15 pro but that's what we call innovation  innovation is not a synonym for revolution innovation is the constant search for existing improvement 98% of the objects around you come from what is called incremental innovation, that is to say a contribution continuous small improvements computers household appliances medicines cars and even social and economic systems have all evolved incrementally by small additions innovation works this way for many reasons including return on investment competition maintenance but none of them  it doesn't come close to the main reason why innovation is incremental you do n't want change look at how the general public reacts as soon as a change is too visible the wireless of airpods the notch facial recognition the  disappearance of the Home button folding smartphones even the very concept of a touchscreen phone was rejected at the presentation of the iPhone because people especially wanted not to lose their physical keyboard human being is a creature of habit often preferring security  and the comfort of routine with the uncertainty of change its tolerance for change is inversely proportional to its desire to see it happen and this is ultimately good news because revolutions are sometimes sources of instability while innovation  incremental reinforces security, relevance and longevity of a product which is undoubtedly not the most exciting because we already know it but which is better at the same time it is precisely what Apple sells you the best  iPhone never designed stainless steel your reasoning being good you have no rational reason to change your iPhone 13 for a 15 you can keep yours but conclude that it is enough to cancel the relevance of a new model is a ticket  of generalization that is to say that you take your personal experience to form a universal conclusion but as the whole planet had not necessarily thought of buying a new iPhone at the same time as you not everyone has an iPhone 13 we  tends to compare models from one year to the next and that's normal but the popular belief that iPhone owners buy the new model every year has no basis in reality the average is  every three to four years every year people buy an iPhone but the novelty is not necessarily the cause they may just need a new phone because theirs is broken steal lost or simply starting to get worn  a little old so Apple releases a new one every year to meet the demand of those who need it at that time these people are probably very happy that the 15 exists because they will benefit from the year's result  of incremental innovation which inevitably led to the best iPhone ever designed we can discuss it in the comments but if you think that the iPhone 15 is broken it's probably because it is not intended for you thank you all thank you at this stage thanks to inox who I love by the way but I do my job it was at DEF [Music]"

starting to get a whole bunch of the most interesting iPhone 15 stuff I kind of want to summarize it all I think iPhone 15 Pro also is the more interesting one definitely because that seems like the one we're gonna where we're gonna see the most new stuff so I'll just I'll scroll down this list a little bit for you guys and maybe give me your reactions I'll also have some of my own first reaction thinner bezels do we care it's not care so much 30 thinner bezel slightly thinner bezels I mean it's cool the most we get to full screen full screen it's better it's gonna look just like the the old phone just a slightly thinner bezel it's one of those things that'll look nicer we'll all see it and be like that's really nice no one else will like really yeah understand it yeah yeah I mean 30 of that small of a bezel already yeah and already uniform bezels not super you know not amazing but okay cool uh titanium frame so moving from our precious we have aluminum on the non-pro and we have stainless steel on the pro right now titanium that's how we're feeling about is that what the Appalachian Ultra is made of uh let's look it up I think it's titanium it's obviously super important also my Fuji film tx1 is titanium and I really like that material isn't there a song called titanium Apple watch Ultra is made with titanium that's right as they call it Aerospace grade that's because they use titanium they use titanium in space so now it's Aerospace great titanium okay like I can say you use uh Aerospace grade mayonnaise mayonnaise exactly they probably got different mayonnaise in outer space yeah they have regular mayonnaise anything liquid has differences yeah Mania is kind of a liquid so anyway titanium phone how do we feel about uh slightly different material it's gonna be lighter because that lighter than steel okay that's good yeah it's a game changer I think I'm gonna go to the whole Apple ecosystem this feels like one of those things where like Apple knows they can't or don't want to make the phone exactly the same as last year so they need something to make it look and feel just a little different from last year so you know that's the new one they don't use the S model any the S thing anymore right so every year they actually do have to do something slightly different like from 12 to 13 they made the um the notch smaller 13 to 14 they made Dynamic Island right 14 to 15. so now every year you get at least a slight change in look yeah and I think that's so people because that's the app it'll be like that's the new one exactly that's exactly I literally think that's the primary thing they're trying to accomplish with that it is it's like every year you have to have that like note at the end of the video like if you're upgrading from last year it's probably not worth it because it's only this minuscule difference this year it's gonna be like it's titanium yeah if you really want titanium upgrade yeah other than that smaller bezels and slightly smaller but I'm sure it'll have a better camera but yeah here's one we've talked about a little bit but we can give a quick synopsis action button might be replacing the mute switch but you could have it be a mute yeah so we didn't talk about that last time we just talked about it having an action button but now the rumor is that button will be replacing the mute switch um I think yeah it could be the mute switch it could be something else I think it would be really sick if you could map that to like your focus mode or even a GPS location so doesn't the Apple watch Ultra like have Dynamic uh action buttons it has the action button and you can map in the watch app what you want it to do which is a couple based on location I think we know I think that was like something we said would be really cool when that happens like imagine you're working out you're on the gym or the track that action button is relevant to where so when you're inside an app yes like if I'm in a track workout it can detect that I'm at a track and now the action button is giving me like lap timer segments but as far as just like on my home screen hit the action button it's like this will either launch a certain app or start a workout okay basically yeah but it can do a bunch of other stuff now which I think is really cool I would prefer to have a button that does multiple things than just mute a thing so yeah yeah I'm going to try my hardest to map this to Google Assistant I don't know what it's going to take you can but I'm gonna try you could probably just make a um it's probably gonna be a serious shortcut yeah yeah yeah all right so that's that what about USB type c yes it seems like it is gaining steam as a possible iPhone 15 Pro feature um and it's it's going to be hilarious as they Market it alongside a lightning iPhone 15 but they're going to be like oh you can shoot prores and you can get faster footage off of the phone this is the bet we should make because there's two options here there's two options yeah either they put USBC in both the 15 and the pro and they only put Thunderbolt in the Pro or they put it in the Pro but they keep lightning on the 50 because they do have an extra year they're they're doing it a year ahead of when the EU is making them right okay so I was thinking about iPad when you said that and in an iPad Pro it's Thunderbolt and USBC and in a regular iPad Air it's just USBC exactly but they also didn't come out at the same time so there was a brief period where there was a thunderbolt iPad Pro and a lightning iPad Air before they switched it but with this it's going to be the phones all launch at once so I think I if I'm if I'm betting I think they're gonna do J [Music] [Laughter] I'll place my bet I hope I think I'm going to be wrong but the the possibility of this happening it would be so funny if there was a lightning and a USBC I think the announce did the same thing and I'm gonna take that bet just because I assume you guys will bet the opposite and then I can bask in them it's hilarity of that happening and both of you losing I think they're equally possible it would be so funny you're the Thunderbolt and regular USBC makes so much more sense like give it you'd have to Brand it though they'd have to Brand it like Pro Data I think they're gonna brand it they're gonna it's gonna be a hilarious yeah well because remember when they finally we've had 60 hertz iPhones for an eternity and there was that moment on stage where they got to the iPhone 13 14 pro whatever it was and it was like promotion and you're like oh I see what she did there you just called 120 hertz ltpo something Pro so you can put it in the Pro phone not the bass phone but now they're stuck with it I think they can phones only yeah that's true but does that mean so is that the regular 15 will also be 60 hertz so I think that yeah yeah okay so that's interesting so if they only move USBC to the Pro phone that would imply that it's a pro feature that's never going to come that way but why else would they only put it in one of the phones you know to get you to buy it because I feel like if they only put it in the Pro phone they have to Brand it as a pro feature and that kind of gets them stuck so they have to put it in both there's already that rumor of like how how the regular phone is going to get some of these like features that are all like Dynamic Island and the hole punch will come I forget what was it like 20 20 no the dynamic island is already coming is coming to the 15 regular right because it's not a pro feature right it's just Dynamic which was my bet yeah I just want to remind so anything that they put that they brand as Pro yeah imply that they're going to keep it in the Pro forever USB type c may not be branded as Pro it could just be a dynamic port or something hilarious what they could do in the like 16 yeah what they could do in the like 16 is they could put 120 hertz but it's not ltpo it's just 60 to 120 and yeah in the regular promotion and it wouldn't be promotion interesting so I don't know regular people would have no idea what that means but yeah that's fair I I think they both I think they um I think they both get USBC yeah yeah interesting I'm willing to take the back side I love that badge for the yeah this is the the big Underdog the only possible like there is something to be said about them making the regular one still lightning because they can just milk the lightning port for a little bit longer because they're making licensing money on all of them and they'll also have a reason for people to upgrade from the 15 to the 16 when it finally gets USBC yeah because this is the thing once you get you once you get USBC on people's radar for the iPhone then it's like okay air pods all these other accessories everything else people are going to start having to think about USBC and the iPhone and so when the next one comes out they're going to have oh USBC is now in all of the iPhones all the accessories hop on board by the port and the accessories again like all that stuff Apple thinks about this a lot they definitely had this exact conversation my most anticipated moment of the iPhone event this year is how they are going to tell the world that USBC is so much better yeah I'm like so excited for this revolutionary report from the iPad Pro and we've put it in the iPhone from the Nexus 6p yeah let me put it in the iPhone to be fair we just went on a work trip and Brandon's phone died in the middle of the night because he didn't realize he brought a USBC cable instead of a lightning cable till like all of us were asleep that happened to me too this weekend yeah I literally only brought a USBC cable and I forgot to bring a lightning one and my iPhone died yeah it's like well I'm screwed the day is gonna have a slide about like one charger forever I'm still doing Johnny I'm doing Johnny Ives voice like it's still him but it's not even it's just gonna be like an executive on stage like so now you can use one charger for your iPad your MacBook and your phone how incredible is that they're also we're gonna give you a special a special brick where you can plug in two USBC things at once yeah it's gonna be great there are rumors that the new Air the airpods pro which are still the two or they're just gonna add USBC to that too they should just keep it lighting just to mess with us and airpods Max are also like they would have to update which it is around time for them to update the airpods max so if they if they do release airpod Max 2 with USBC that would be nice that would be insane to do all those things as USB and then still ship a lightning iPhone that seems insane that would be so funny but doesn't the cheapest iPad come with lightning it does still have lightning yeah oh the like super and so and so the cheapest but the cheapest iPhone can still be the s C yeah that's true maybe that's that's true no uh also there is a rumor that the next Apple watch uh it didn't say specifically whether it was the ultra which is apparently getting an Ultra 2 this year nice um which the ultra 2 is apparently going to be coming in matte black uh was that real or was it I saw like a render that's easily the most exciting thing it's a rumor it's a rumor yeah yeah I think um I saw a concept of it but basically every single year they use what is effectively the same chipset in the Apple watch like they update they update it very very slightly every year but it is almost not different at all but there's a rumor that apparently this year it's going to be significantly faster which is like cool it's nice yeah man Snoopy's gonna run great on it yeah I mean we have they changed the UI too with watch OS and now there's a bunch of widgets maybe they want to sort of like push this big update to the watch sort of shake things up a little bit with the watch if it's a significant node size change then maybe battery life will be improved that would be nice that would be really nice yeah okay so yeah that's kind of the Apple rumors uh we got a month until that happens like Apple watch is the craziest thing we've said this podcast matte black because I know we've had a matte black watch but it's like midnight so it's not really black oh that's a good point so like actually what if it winds up being midnight I would be so mad Matt midnight would you rather midnight or the silver that you have I like the silver I love it I love how good that looks honestly I'd say silver but it's not black matte black oh of course yeah yeah please please if that's not if that's not finalized yet someone at Apple can you just press that button lock that in please hey thanks for watching this clip um I think we should end this this outro with just uh rumors and speculation about the next episode of waveform what do you think what's going on Siri are you gonna be in the next podcast episode I heard confirmed confirmed next episode is over an hour long confirmed that's what I heard oh she agrees she agrees sorry agrees I heard it's gonna be slightly better bet she disagrees slightly better no shot she's like I don't think so I heard it's gonna have 700 000 views confirmed confirmed or is that just speculation uh as long as everyone likes and subscribes this clip it could happen so give her the mic give her the mic yeah oh she's scared of the mic oh my God don't scare her Ellis I'm sorry guys what the heck oh she's back scaring a dog what do you push over old people too like And subscribe laughs

I want that luxury  Treat yourself to the new chip that is faster and better like every year. Now be completely honest with yourself.
